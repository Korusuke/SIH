       "  'Problem Statement – Design a Float that is very light in weight, for working condition of Pressure 20Bar & Temperature 220°C. The Float should be able to withstand 100 cycles of external high pressure pulse of 100Bar.            Additional details – In many process plants steam is used as a source of energy. Efficient distribution of steam is critical for maintaining process parameters and ensuring that energy wastage is minimal. An important equipment, part of the distribution network, is the steam trap. A Steam trap is an automatic drain valve which distinguishes between steam and condensate. A well-functioning steam trap will hold back steam in the distribution line while discharging condensate under varying pressures or loads. When the steam trap fails, it can lead to water logging (condensate) in distribution pipes, thus reducing the efficiency of steam energy, disturb process parameters, or even lead to wastage of steam through discharge in open atmosphere. Steam traps are mechanical equipment which employs different principles such as buoyancy, pressure, temperature etc. for their operation.',\n",
       "  'A ball float type trap is based on the buoyancy principle where rise in condensate level lifts the ball float, opening the orifice and allowing the condensate to be flushed out of steam carrying pipes. In certain processes, typically on -off heating processes, opening of the valve causes sudden discharge of condensate at very high velocity to the trap. The high velocity water discharge impinges on the float causing it to implode. The ON-OFF cycles expose float to thermal cycle. An efficient and robust design of float is desired to overcome this problem.',\n",
       "  'Currently, Float of 32 gms ( ±4gms), Diameter 57mm , working Pressure 20Bar and Temperature 220°C is used in typical Float Traps.        (A video of one kind of steam trap operation is shared)',\n",

       "  'Problem Statement – Design a Float that is very light in weight, for working condition of Pressure 20Bar & Temperature 220°C. The Float should be able to withstand 100 cycles of external high pressure pulse of 100Bar.            Additional details – In many process plants steam is used as a source of energy. Efficient distribution of steam is critical for maintaining process parameters and ensuring that energy wastage is minimal. An important equipment, part of the distribution network, is the steam trap. A Steam trap is an automatic drain valve which distinguishes between steam and condensate. A well-functioning steam trap will hold back steam in the distribution line while discharging condensate under varying pressures or loads. When the steam trap fails, it can lead to water logging (condensate) in distribution pipes, thus reducing the efficiency of steam energy, disturb process parameters, or even lead to wastage of steam through discharge in open atmosphere. Steam traps are mechanical equipment which employs different principles such as buoyancy, pressure, temperature etc. for their operation.',\n",
       "  'A ball float type trap is based on the buoyancy principle where rise in condensate level lifts the ball float, opening the orifice and allowing the condensate to be flushed out of steam carrying pipes. In certain processes, typically on -off heating processes, opening of the valve causes sudden discharge of condensate at very high velocity to the trap. The high velocity water discharge impinges on the float causing it to implode. The ON-OFF cycles expose float to thermal cycle. An efficient and robust design of float is desired to overcome this problem.',\n",
       "  'Currently, Float of 32 gms ( ±4gms), Diameter 57mm , working Pressure 20Bar and Temperature 220°C is used in typical Float Traps.        (A video of one kind of steam trap operation is shared)'],\n",

Temperature increase of frozen product will result in off-flavors, rancidity, dehydration, weight loss, and loss of juiciness, drip loss, toughening, microbial spoilage and autolysis of the product. Therefore, it is absolutely critical that frozen conditions are maintained during transportation, storage, and in retail stores.

       "  'India is a country with the second largest road network in the world. Out of the total stretch of 5.4 million km of road network, almost 97,991 km is covered by national highways. Challenges in traffic management and congestion cause huge financial, environmental, and physiological costs to the individual and to the government. On an average, a person spends anywhere between 30 minutes to 2 hours of their day commuting, accounting to almost 520 hours a year. It is estimated that the traffic congestion in the four metro cities costs the nation approximately Rs. 1.5 lakh crore (more than the annual Railway budget for this year) {Reference:1,2}.',\n",
       "  'This problem statement focuses on developing a specialized aerial solution for automatic aerial analysis of traffic activity in highways and city roads using Unmanned aerial vehicles. The end goal is to explore new possibilities in the field of traffic analysis by its fully automatic calculation of a wide range of traffic parameters such as speed, densities, time, and pollution levels.',\n",

The Float should be able to withstand 100 cycles of external high pressure pulse of 100Bar.            Additional details – In many process plants steam is used as a source of energy. Efficient distribution of steam is critical for maintaining process parameters and ensuring that energy wastage is minimal. An important equipment, part of the distribution network, is the steam trap. A Steam trap is an automatic drain valve which distinguishes between steam and condensate. A well-functioning steam trap will hold back steam in the distribution line while discharging condensate under varying pressures or loads. When the steam trap fails, it can lead to water logging (condensate) in distribution pipes, thus reducing the efficiency of steam energy, disturb process parameters, or even lead to wastage of steam through discharge in open atmosphere. Steam traps are mechanical equipment which employs different principles such as buoyancy, pressure, temperature etc. for their operation.',\n",
       "  'A ball float type trap is based on the buoyancy principle where rise in condensate level lifts the ball float, opening the orifice and allowing the condensate to be flushed out of steam carrying pipes. In certain processes, typically on -off heating processes, opening of the valve causes sudden discharge of condensate at very high velocity to the trap. The high velocity water discharge impinges on the float causing it to implode. The ON-OFF cycles expose float to thermal cycle. An efficient and robust design of float is desired to overcome this problem.',\n",

The Float should be able to withstand 100 cycles of external high pressure pulse of 100Bar.            Additional details – In many process plants steam is used as a source of energy. Efficient distribution of steam is critical for maintaining process parameters and ensuring that energy wastage is minimal. An important equipment, part of the distribution network, is the steam trap. A Steam trap is an automatic drain valve which distinguishes between steam and condensate. A well-functioning steam trap will hold back steam in the distribution line while discharging condensate under varying pressures or loads. When the steam trap fails, it can lead to water logging (condensate) in distribution pipes, thus reducing the efficiency of steam energy, disturb process parameters, or even lead to wastage of steam through discharge in open atmosphere. Steam traps are mechanical equipment which employs different principles such as buoyancy, pressure, temperature etc. for their operation.',\n",
       "  'A ball float type trap is based on the buoyancy principle where rise in condensate level lifts the ball float, opening the orifice and allowing the condensate to be flushed out of steam carrying pipes. In certain processes, typically on -off heating processes, opening of the valve causes sudden discharge of condensate at very high velocity to the trap. The high velocity water discharge impinges on the float causing it to implode. The ON-OFF cycles expose float to thermal cycle. An efficient and robust design of float is desired to overcome this problem.',\n",
       "  'Currently, Float of 32 gms ( ±4gms), Diameter 57mm , working Pressure 20Bar and Temperature 220°C is used in typical Float Traps.        (A video of one kind of steam trap operation is shared)'],\n",

The product quality in a process is affected by both, process and environmental parameters. In case of a hygroscopic organic product, moisture plays a vital role in determining the end product quality. In the case of this problem it is crucial to maintain the end product moisture level within a narrow band for superior product quality. To achieve the same, online control of various process parameters is required in manufacturing.',\n",
       "  'PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: The manufacturing process of this product has a drying step which is controlled to get the end product moisture within limits. However, post drying, the retention time and conditions in further process steps impact the final product moisture. The incoming material loses moisture in the drying process. The dryer process parameters are controlled through a PID loop with short and long term levers. Post drying, the product is stored in a conditioned environment and is transferred for manufacture as per requirement. Product interacts with the surrounding environment while residing in the storage area and the manufacturing process. Due to these interactions, the product moisture changes from the desired value of 13.5+/-0.3%. Building a time series machine learning model to predict Ex- Dryer moisture set point will help to achieve Ex-Packing moisture within 13.5+/-0.3% with maximum accuracy.',\n",

       "  'BACKGROUND: Achieving consistency in product quality is one of the key objectives in a manufacturing process. The product quality in a process is affected by both, process and environmental parameters. In case of a hygroscopic organic product, moisture plays a vital role in determining the end product quality. In the case of this problem it is crucial to maintain the end product moisture level within a narrow band for superior product quality. To achieve the same, online control of various process parameters is required in manufacturing.',\n",
       "  'PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: The manufacturing process of this product has a drying step which is controlled to get the end product moisture within limits. However, post drying, the retention time and conditions in further process steps impact the final product moisture. The incoming material loses moisture in the drying process. The dryer process parameters are controlled through a PID loop with short and long term levers. Post drying, the product is stored in a conditioned environment and is transferred for manufacture as per requirement. Product interacts with the surrounding environment while residing in the storage area and the manufacturing process. Due to these interactions, the product moisture changes from the desired value of 13.5+/-0.3%. Building a time series machine learning model to predict Ex- Dryer moisture set point will help to achieve Ex-Packing moisture within 13.5+/-0.3% with maximum accuracy.',\n",

       "  'India is a country with the second largest road network in the world. Out of the total stretch of 5.4 million km of road network, almost 97,991 km is covered by national highways. Challenges in traffic management and congestion cause huge financial, environmental, and physiological costs to the individual and to the government. On an average, a person spends anywhere between 30 minutes to 2 hours of their day commuting, accounting to almost 520 hours a year. It is estimated that the traffic congestion in the four metro cities costs the nation approximately Rs. 1.5 lakh crore (more than the annual Railway budget for this year) {Reference:1,2}.',\n",

One theory is that doctor prescribes a brand because they trust the quality. Another theory is that they have a certain evoked set of brands and divides the prescriptions arbitrarily based on the brand that comes to their mind. Another theory is that doctor prescribes a brand because of personal working relationship or even in some cases out of sympathy due to general longer waiting time of MRs to meet him/her.',\n",

       "  \"Majority of the factory automation today is done using isolated PLC controllers which can control components of a single sub-system (CNC, Pump, Boiler etc) at a time. These need to be re-programmed as per the job running on the factory floor since the same plant is used to manufacture different products. The cycle time between these changes is quite large and is prone to errors (since one of the machines may be incorrectly programmed) and it's difficult to do a factory wide what-if analysis of such changes. The challenge is to develop an IoT platform that can allow simple Visual Programming using open source libraries like Google Blockly to specify new program to be done across all different PLC controllers. On the hardware side, the PLC controllers should be bluetooth connected and running the Bluetooth Automation I/O profile/service. There should be a central server which can communicate with all the PLC controllers over bluetooth. User should be able to specify new programms using visual programming (e.g. When the boiler PLC controller Analog input 1 detects value > 100 then turn the motor connected to output 2 of the Cooling system PLC controller etc). When the program is done, it should be possible for the user to execute this program from the central server which acts as a co-ordinator executing this logic across all PLC controllers over bluetooth by reading and writing corresponding Bluetooth low energy characteristics as specified by Automation I/O profile.\",\n",

With time, the insulation begins to age, and it causes deterioration in the performance of the insulation. Harsh operating environments where the electrical insulation is exposed to extreme operating temperatures, moisture, and chemical contamination, as experienced on a ship, will accelerate the deterioration process. It's extremely critical to always  know the electrical condition(IR) of the insulation in ship's electrical equipment at all times to avoid any accident such as electrical shock, fire, short circuit etc.   Scope: New design of motor shell body and rubber gasket of motor Junction Box required to maintain IP protection of motor for long duration.\",\n",

The gap between the torque and speed required at the wheels vs the torque and speed generated by the engine is bridged by the elements of power train. Power train components occupy volume inside the vehicle and also contribute for the weight while the transmission efficiency impacts the overall fuel efficiency of the vehicle. Power is drawn from the engine to drive the fan for cooling the heat generated in engine, transmission and hydraulic system, etc. Innovative power train concepts which can facilitate power transmission in heavy machinery like mining dump trucks are being solicited.

Parameters such as soil moisture, crop type, seasons weather forecast, can be measured and well used in optimizing water delivery as well as biological micro-nutrients in some form.

Detecting heart rate using only camera has an added advantage because in such case the users do not require any skills or compliance, but has to just capture image/video. During exercise, it is often desired that the user can measure their heart rate without any extra accessory. Wearing a wearable during exercise can be uncomfortable to certain users. Catering to the phenomenon of people using camera as the most popular smartphone feature we can address this problem.',\n",

Whenever our heart circulates blood, the amount of light reflected from the face varies. To the human eye, this variation is invisible. But using image processing techniques we can detect these changes. The underlying principle is to analyse the spatio-temporal variations in the time-series facial images and amplify these variations. The time series of color values at pixels in region of interest is used to estimate the heart rate. For this work data needs to be collected at various lighting conditions: i) Daytime Outdoor (Cloudy and Sunny) ii) Daytime Indoor iii) Night-time Indoor. Data needs to be acquired for resting and exercising condition. This work broadly requires work in the domain of video processing, signal processing and basic concepts of machine learning.',\n",

       "  'Smart phone application that measures heartrate using on-board cameras in real-time and non-invasively offers several advantages and have multiple use cases. Detecting heart rate using only camera has an added advantage because in such case the users do not require any skills or compliance, but has to just capture image/video. During exercise, it is often desired that the user can measure their heart rate without any extra accessory. Wearing a wearable during exercise can be uncomfortable to certain users. Catering to the phenomenon of people using camera as the most popular smartphone feature we can address this problem.',\n",
       "  'This work will predominantly focus on estimating Heart Rate in real-time from facial images captured using smartphone camera.  With every Heart Beat blood flows to our face. Whenever our heart circulates blood, the amount of light reflected from the face varies. To the human eye, this variation is invisible. But using image processing techniques we can detect these changes. The underlying principle is to analyse the spatio-temporal variations in the time-series facial images and amplify these variations. The time series of color values at pixels in region of interest is used to estimate the heart rate. For this work data needs to be collected at various lighting conditions: i) Daytime Outdoor (Cloudy and Sunny) ii) Daytime Indoor iii) Night-time Indoor. Data needs to be acquired for resting and exercising condition. This work broadly requires work in the domain of video processing, signal processing and basic concepts of machine learning.'],\n",

Even if an app is provided to the sales executive to capture all footfalls, it is at his discretion whether to use it or not and a large scale makes it difficult to monitor the same.

The process involves manual monitoring and there is no tracking mechanism for the garbage carrying vehicles and garbage load. A new system can be developed to monitor the garbage vehicles in a particular ward of a corporation to obtain optimization in terms of route and garbage collection. The  garbage vehicles and push carts can be fitted with sensors and based on the GPS location, the vehicles can be monitored to cover all areas of an ward. The vehicles should be compartmentalized for dry and wet waste to avoid the mixing of garbage. As of now the segregation of dry and wet waste is being enforced in many localities and the same should be followed while loading the garbage vehicles. The push carts used to collect garbage are not designed correctly, most of the garbage spills over the road during transportation. Battery operated carts can replace the existing push carts. In many cities of China, the point to point collection is done by battery operated vehicles and mostly driven by women. A node can be developed for a particular ward and monitored. A new app can be developed to help the citizens to locate the garbage vehicles and the timing of its arrival which helps in proper planning of disposal of garbage.',\n",

Our crops are under threat from the day they are seeded til they are harvested causing significant damage to the crop affecting adversely to the farmer's economy. Many factors influence disease development and growth of insect that includes genetics of variety, plant growth stage, weather, soil etc. Most of these information on insects, disease etc has been identified and documented by the Scientists of National Agricultural Research System (ICAR). This documentation will have a better significance if they are reached out to the farming community whenever they need it. Developing a web or mobile app having a complete knowledge base of insect pest carrying its detail  in the background will be of great help. It will help  in identifying the insect pest in the farmers field based on the damaged symptom or by the image of the insects. On identifying the insect pest the system may provide the  management.\",\n",

Management levels and production constraints vary spatially and temporally in these environments. Therefore crop/location specific management practices are needed to increase  productivity of Rice crop. The traditional way of collecting precise information by sampling from fields requires lots of manpower and time. As spatial variations in land, soil, water, weather etc. are influencing the productivity of  Rice crop, the modern space technologies can appropriately be utilized to derive the precise information in shorter time. Many GIS softwares like ARCGIS, ERDAS Imagine, QGIS etc are available for analysing the spatial data. These spatial files can be utilised further to integrate with other simulation models  or  visualise  these spatial variations to end users. Hence, development of geo referenced map interface is needed to visualise the map along with attribute data and attributes wise classification of the data. Once developed, this interface can be utilised  for any other crops/cropping systems.',\n",

LEDs have useful lifetimes in the tens of thousands of hours as compared to thousand or so offered by incandescent bulbs. Problems being faced are, Failure in any of several LEDs on COB (Chip on Board) fixture components can cause the whole LED to fail............LEDs generate heat. LEDs need to be connected to heat sinks to move the heat energy away from the LED, then the heat sinks need to be engineered to get rid of that heat somehow. If LEDs are not cooled, they degrade very quickly, then fail completely. This issue of LEDs generating heat may be addressed',\n",

Agricultural sector is responsible for 78 per cent of water use in the country. Presently, there are over 20 million wells pumping water with free power supply, subsidised by the Government. This has aggravated the issue of declining water table (0.4 m per year), while encouraging wastage of water in many states. The mounting pressure on water resources justifies that sustainable use of water resources is fundamental priority in Indian agriculture. Since, water is the most limiting factor in agriculture, technology interventions for sustainable use of water resources at grass root level is the need of the hour. In context of depleting groundwater, there is a need to address the issues relating sustainable crop production and rational water use based on the green and blue water footprints. Technology innovations, evidently, a mobile based low cost smart irrigation assistant for guiding irrigation scheduling encouraging green water consumption at farmers field is to be developed. Water conservation for supplementary irrigation and strengthening irrigation facilities in the state will have much more impact on reducing water footprints.',\n",

Each FG has usable parameters viz. an Identification Number (UID), Quality Indicators (QINDs) and Weight (WTG). The FGs are arranged in DSA with help of Fork Lifts in a defined and orderly manner in specified zones. The DSA is demarcated into physical smaller grids/zones of 5 X 5 mtr in a physical manner with markers placed on the periphery of DSA.n.b. – \\tEach FG weighs approx. 980kg +/- 0-30kg.Each TRUCK is to be loaded with approx. 9-10T of FG as per LS.Operation-A.\\tFrom the PB area the FGs are shifted by the Operator to DSA and are arranged at specific physical Grid Locations with help of Fork Lifts.B.\\tAt the day end, Dispatch Plan is prepared for next day and truck placement request is sent to FG picker and Transporter.C.\\tThe Picker identifies the require material at DSA as per the Dispatch plan.D.\\tThe truck enters the plant and tare weight (TW) is recorded, QIND, Total Quantity to be Dispatched (TQTY), Truck Number (TN) is recorded on the Loading Slip (LS) before being directed to DSA.E.\\tWith given LS (UID, TN, QIND and TQTY) the Fork Lift operator locate, reach, pick and loads the material identified by picker on to the truck.F.\\tThe Loading Slip (LS) is completed recording specific FG UIDs and the truck moves towards the weighbridge for final weighment and then proceeds to the DISPATCH section for billing.Problem-Placement of FG in the specified ZONE in DSA while receiving from PB is very difficult …..During shifting of FGs from PB to DSA, the physical storage Location is not digitally linked on Database to the UID of FG causing problem locating in a later time while tracing for loading on to a truck.Locating the FG in DSA leading to higher TURN AROUND time …..At times due to some local problem of space, non-adherence to set procedure, unloading from a Consigner Truck, rearrangement of FGs within DSA, etc. the FG gets mis-located within the DSA and are difficult to locate, reach, pick and load  the FG in a timely and efficient manner while loading the consigner truck.Manual LS preparation and multiple point of data entry ……The Loading Slip (LS) details are recorded on a paper and sent to Invoicing team for processing.Defining a proper zone and storage of FG for ease of accessibility …..Improvements Desired-To devise a procedure that is automated, smart and intelligent to bring in Quicker turn-around time of Truck Loadinga.\\tAssistance to the process of Shifting FGs to DSA from PBb.\\tTag the FG with GRID Identity to facilitate the Dispatch Processc.\\tSuggest Fork Lift Operator the next FG to pickd.\\tOption with Fork Lift Operator to look out for an alternate FGe.\\tProvide/Display a FG map overlaying the GRID of DSA',\n",
