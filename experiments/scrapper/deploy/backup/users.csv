I have and am developing skills in blockchain, backend development in frameworks like NodeJs and languages like golang with new ways to design APIs, machine learning basics and a beginner in competitive coding.
I've made some small scale projects like Mail As A Service (Maas) for providing mailing services to small projects, Certifier - an online certification system using blockchain, AttendiFi - <b>a decentralised attendance</b> system which does not require internet and many more.
I've also worked with Crescibit Technology Pvt.

Hola! I am Ayush Shah. Yes it's a highly common name with more common surname, you must have heard . I am currently pursuing my Information Technology(B-Tech_TYIT) Degree from KJSCE. I yearn to become a very successful Developer.

I have worked as an intern in this field front-end and Back-end or call-it-as pure Coding field for few months. 
Learning new things have always been a great matter of interest for me and i always look forward to learning new things .
Hackathons have always been a great field of interest 
for me ,maybe because we secured 2nd place in the 1st
ever Hackathon we participated in. I suppose it is a 
great platform for innovative minds to showcase their skills

Coding is my love, but not the only love. I am deeply into music.I can listen to the sweet pieces of heaven for like hours. Also playing music calms me down.
5000 Words are totally not sufficient to be my bio, but for professional purpose I think all of the Links,Resume,Experience etc adds up to be enough.
And about SIH , I want to participate in it since it is the world-cup for programmers and i want to win it ,
for me, my team and my college.

Its been more than 2 years since I've started coding and the everyday challenges have helped in developing and shaping my problem solving abilities. From multiple web development projects to an endless array of prototyping and automating projects, you’ll find me in front of the computer, either coding or binge-watching a new series.

I have worked on various projects since 2nd Year of college and I have been constantly working on several projects one after the other. 
From learning to code in C/C++ during my 1st Year in college to exploring java, python, and developing multiple websites to participating in several hackathons during the 2nd year to actively exploring my interests in ML and DL, this has been an amazing experience.

Working in a team, I developed an online video-game review website and contributed extensively to its design. Since then, I’ve familiarised myself with and honed my skills in HTML, CSS, Javascript,Python, Django, Flask, Ajax, etc. and have developed countless websites(Somaiya-crowdfunding website, Invoice/PO analyzer, etc). 
As a member of The Marine Robotics Team of my college, I worked extensively in the fields of data annotation and image preprocessing, and also learned a few basic CV and ML algorithms. I’ve also worked with languages such as Java, C, C++, C#, etc. and have worked with Python libraries such as Matplotlib, Pandas, OpenCV, Google text to speech, etc. as a part of some projects I have been working on currently.

Have been playing with computers for quite a few years now. The things that they could do fascinated me, but I didn't have a clear path etched out for me to follow, en route to being a Computer Engineer. Opting in for BTech in Computer Engineering, opened new avenues for me. Seniors and faculties alike, who helped me tread my way. I started out small by building static websites for the college fests, which really got me into development in my second year, from then on web development has stuck with me. Alongside, also got into competitive programming with my friends at college, and ended up getting selected for ICPC regional rounds.
The captivating world of computers and their endless possibilities drives me to venture more and more in it. Recently learned React, and from what I used to do earlier, cramming in HTML intertwined with CSS and JS  to build web pages, it was ugly, though node packages helped to an extent, React opened a whole new way for front end development ! Alongside this hunger to delve into newer technologies, the inherent feeling to help people out, has also driven me. As technology is something that can breach boundaries to help and assist people. 
Apart from making static web pages for college fests, also interned at ERPnext, for making their next ERP product on the Frappe framework with VueJs. Understanding and handling such a big codebase, how the components interacted and interfaced was something complex, and new to figure out.
Apart from web development, have also delved into Blockchain and Machine learning. Participated in my first blockchain hackathon recently, it was fun and frustrating at the same time. Fun, for something new we learned and frustrating for how volatile and changing the solidity ethereum network is, every 30 minutes we would run into a new error, Insufficient gas!
On machine learning front, following the bible that is - Stanford Machine Learning- Andrew Ng course, almost done with it. In parallel, looking into its application as well, using Tensorflow, to build neural nets and predict celebrity faces, that is.
That's most of the work I have done on the tech side, other hobbies include, music, movies, tv-series, paying attention to those details in them. Also, taking long walks, listening to podcasts, cycling and organizing stuff,  is fast growing to be a favorite hobby as well.
Getting selected to this hackathon, will open new doors to network and learn from like-minded people out there, scribble down and implement new ideas, and maybe just maybe, collaborate on something big in the future !",Comps,B,Neel,Male,Shah,Manilal,9769222514,https://drive.google.com/a/somaiya.edu/file/d/18FeIYHj0lLks7K-5--CjGdxO2ECFa-0A/view?usp=drivesdk,1611105,Fourth,9bab7430-a218-4ab5-96a1-a6e5fd6acba7

I am an IT undergraduate student in the third year at K. J. Somaiya College of Engineering.
I am participating in this Hackathon because I love to come up with elegant solutions for complex problems, which can be helpful to everyone as well as easy to understand.
I usually spend my time solving challenges on Hackerrank, where I earned the Gold Badge for Problem Solving and Java.
I have great command over Java and C, and beginner level experience using Python and Javascript.
As much as I love coding, I am also good at Mathematics. I am the Technical Head of the Math Club of my college, where I prepare content and questions for various technical and mathematical events. I can also do very large calculations in my head as a result of my love for numbers.
I always look forward to new challenges, and I would like to use my skills to participate and win the Smart India Hackathon.

First and foremost, I aspire to be great at programming in general. Right now I am learning python as it has a lot to offer and can make my job(problems) easier. I have not participated in a lot of Hackathons but the ones I have participated in, helped me learn a lot about competitions and the environment there. My team and I were runner ups in the first hackathon that we participated in and it gave me a lot of encouragement to participate more. My team and I are still working to make the same project better as of now. Since then I want to participate in as many hackathons as I can so that I can keep up with and learn the new languages and technology that has come to the market and the ones that will come in the future. I intend to solve more and more problems using different programming languages that I encounter in competitions and in life(just kidding).
I love coding for math related problems and I do it in my free time on Hackerrank and Codechef. Along with that I am a huge ""binge watch"" person, be it a web series or an anime or back to back movies. I also love singing(who doesn't?) which is totally out of context here but I have to mention it anyways.

Because of these things I am always excited for participating in a hackathon. I have participated in a number of local hackathons. In one of the hackathon named as 'Mumbai Hackathon', my friends and I were building a source based news web application + chatbot  where in the user has the control over the feed from any given source in any given language. The tough part was implementing this for local languages like Hindi and we were able to do it and we won the Hackathon. Here is the link for the project : https://github.com/team-anything/Briefly. The things that I learned is the desire to make a product in less time along with having patience and good environment in the team.

Building webapps,chatbots and writing scripts to automate the daily life boring tasks is what I love doing.
Of late I am moving on to JavaScript as my primary language of development.I am getting familiar with Node.Js development in general and have made a few projects using the JS stack. I have also started exploring blockchain and Dapps, look forward to explore them further.

I have been in a peer team along with whom I have been attending various hackathons throughout the year building several projects, which you can find in the org we have created (https://github.com/team-anything).
I have always been fascinated by the various evolutions in technology that happen around the world. It is this curiosity to discover happens under the hood that drives me build and re-engineer things.Plus, having this good peer group makes it possible attend hackathons and keep building products, which in itself is driving factor.

Of all the different projects that I have been a part of, most of which have been hackathon prototypes, The most complex of the product has to be our news scrapper + summarizer,which we like to call briefly. This was the product which we identified needs to be available to save us from those big articles and at the same time have the choice of source being our own.
During this hackathon, half way throught the time our product had a critical functionality error that it could not accommodate non english text, as pointed by one of the mentors, so we decide we need to create such a completely new scraper,which was the core functionality of the product,somehow we then ended updoing doing just in time to complete our prototype integrated it with our chatbot.
This was the project where I learned several things like how to build a scraper,how to summarize text using frequency analysis,how to build a pubsub design patter based application along with things like never giving up in time adversity and team spirit.At the end the icing on the cake was the fact that we ended up on the winning side.

Another complex project was HelpOff where we tried to bring the most important features of internet to feature phones, without internet, which is still used by major population of the country. We had to plug down basic features of showing direction, finding nearby address of landmarks into completely text based network. So here we had some trouble dealing with SMS carriers and finding out locations of people but we managed a way out to make a working prototype.
This product also got featured on ProductHunt platform and was appreciated by many for its use-case.

I have been to a few hackathons and have managed to even get some recognition in some of them but this is just the start.
I would like to participate and win some prizes at some major hackathons recognized at the global level which in itself is one of the reason that drives me to keep learning.
It will be great, to be competing with the best developers around the country, get to network with them and at the same time show some of my acquired skill set.",Comps,B,Chirag,Male,Shetty,Avinash,7045185177,https://nurdtechie98.github.io/static/Chirag_Shetty-ef54016a40ea22e1886bdd568dca2bf9.pdf,1611110,Fourth,9bab7430-a218-4ab5-96a1-a6e5fd6acba7

It motivates me that my team's software solution could be solving a real life problem or a requirement. 

I have participated in several hackathons and worked on numerous projects. For Mumbai-Hackathon in my second year,  we decided to make ColorIt – a tool, which, when input with a grayscale image, 
will output it in color. We carried the idea forward, and we completed the project successfully within 24 hours, after much struggle as a team of inexperienced sophomores. Although we didn't win, it was gratifying enough to be shortlisted in the top-10 at my very first hackathon. I developed a project named Tab-Overflow - Chrome extension that can be used to manage tabs, to 
circumvent the issue of shutting and reopening them every day. With Tab-Overflow, one can share or save tabs and open it on any PC. Tabs can be sorted either alphabetically based on title scraped, or clustered according to the similarity of topics. Next, in EthIndia2.0 Hackathon, we developed a novel algorithm to minimize slippage while trading ERC20 tokens. For this, we were awarded the Kyber Networks Bounty of $150 with an honorary mention on their Medium blog. We are writing a research paper on our algorithm in hopes of helping many. I got my first research experience while developing our application, ""Text-It-Loud!"". This application converts speech to text in real-time. We also conducted a live demo of our app in a school for hearing-impaired students. We got an extremely positive response. They said that they would use it as a teaching aid. We have written a research paper on it that got accepted in T4E IEEE Conference 2019 and IEEE Xplore. For KJSCE Hackathon 2018, we were given on the spot topic of developing an event application screening portal. Here, we made used JavaScript to develop neural networks like structure to dynamically solve the problem. In KJSCE Hackathon 2019, we developed AutoHTML - automate the process of UI designing using neural networks. Our app when given a sketch of UI on paper gives "".html"" file with styling as an output. In Dotslash2.0 hackathon, we developed an decentralised application to automate the process of certificate verification. Additionally, 
I was technical head of KJSCE Outreach Center for past 2 years. Here, we have developed a website and an android app for Civil Defence of Maharashtra.

I also have few internship experiences. My first experience of working in the industry was during my internship in APS Powers in freshmen year. Here, I programmed ABB drives in CODESYS for various electronic machinery and designed HMI screens in A-CAD. As an Intern at KJSCE – My team and I made the ""KJSCE Internship Portal"" for K J Somaiya College of Engineering (currently functioning). Here, students can upload their CV and apply for various internships, while faculty can float internships, select students, give feedback, and much more. Furthermore, I implemented features such as generating analysis aids like graphs, PDFs, and Excel 
reports. I also interned as web developer at Swaglok. Swaglok is an eCommerce website. Here I mainly worked on optimising the load time of website. For my internship at RIIDL, we developed and standalone device to aid elderly adults in ordering medicines, booking a doctor appointment, and sending SOS.

I am currently in my third year of pursuing Computer Engineering  at K.J Somaiya College of Engineering.
I have quite some knowledge regarding web development 
but have always thought of working in the field of data science , Although I'm not sure about it yet . I have also interned as a Software Engineer . I always feel like trying out new things and am intrigued by new technologies, I wonder how they work.  I've always wanted to learn something new and probably create something of my own .
This is one opportunity which i want to grab, I've always wondered about hackathons , how people manage to work for 24 hours in one go , I want to be a part of it and learn new things . I think it can be a kick-start for me to trying out new and different things ahead.
I'd like to conclude by telling you that I'm definitely not a computer geek and  have various other interests.I have completed four levels in Kathak and I'm fascinated by it . I'm a huge fan of Brooklyn 99, I love travelling and listening to songs , Playing board games is definitely my thing . I love writing as well and  Sleeping is one thing which I'll never refute at any point of time .

Other than above mentioned my technical background is I have a good programming experience in Python, Java, and C.I have created various projects using web frameworks such as MEAN, PHP + MYSQL, Django, Ruby on Rails, and MeteorJs.I have created various mobile applications using Android and Ionic3.I have created a billing software using electronJs.I am currently learning new tech stacks AI and Blockchain.

I have always been fascinated by the various evolutions in technology that happen around the world. It is this curiosity to discover happens under the hood that drives me build and re-engineer things.Plus, having this good peer group which makes it possible attend hackathons and keep building products, which in itself is driving factor.
I would like to participate and win some prizes at some major hackathons recognized at the global level which in itself is one of the reason that drives me to keep learning.

I love a challenge.

I chose to participate in Smart India Hackathon because this nationwide hackathon poses problems faced by people on a daily basis. No other Hackathon in India works on this scale. This is the major leagues. I would love to contribute to a product that would have the potential to solve an existing problem.

A major part of my skill set is defined by the time I spent in a Robotics team. Not only I learned how to build, program and test robots but also teamwork and hard work. While my time here, I also gained experience in Image Processing and Machine learning.
My skills expand to the domain of development, mainly Frontend - I interned in a web development company which polished my development skills that I had gained in my University. 

It's my dream to do meaningful work, to contribute something to the society, to not only pass exams but also 'Engineer' something for everyone to use. I believe SIH is that platform. A product that would sweep you off your feet is only one selection away.
