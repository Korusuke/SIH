Most of the commercial and residential places face an impending problem of illegal car/vehicle parking inside their premises. This issue is not bounded to just parking, but also adds to the security concerns inside those  establishments. Though there are solutions that exist in the market, the affordability comes into question. In this regard, we would like to have an affordable solution that caters to the Indian marketsExpectation:  For the team choosing this topic, we expect to have a working model / infrastructure of the solution wherein, when a vehicle passes through a  checkpost and the solution identifies as many features as it can regarding the situation of the vehicle. All Teams will be provided with an amount of video footage. The teams must build a fictitous database based on the vehicles appering in footage and demonstrate the problems that they are able to solve/automate in existing infrastucture. (For example, if a team is trying to solve problems of a residential complex, they might create a database of some of the vehicles appearing in the footage and list them as residents and others not registered in the database to be considered as visitors).Applicants will be provided video data through the following website link.http://mixorg.com/competitions/SIH2020/registrationEach team is supposed to download the data and annotate it according to the features they are going to build.Teams must come up with new features for monetization of their business model and must build machine learning models (for preliminary shortlisting and finals) and required mobile/web applications(for finals only) reflecting the same features .Teams are requested to share the annotations done by them on the video data and the pattern of annotation.Teams are requested to build the machine learning model and share a working code on github(privately with chetanbansiwal or publically)Teams will be judged on the following grounds in the same order as written for the next round :<ul><li>Accuracy of the model in performing the expected task.</li><li>Speed of the model in performing the expected task.</li><li>The precision followed during annotation of data.</li><li>The relevance of annotations considering the problem the team is expecting to solve with it.</li></ul>","

This makes the product marketing/ sales cost too high due to low conversion rates on insurance sales. It can be said that two factors contribute to this:<ul><li>Insurance being viewed as an expense rather than a protection</li><li>The long and nonengaging information capture process which is required to issue the insurance.</li></ul>At Bajaj, we are looking to solve this problem by providing a mobile app as an engagement tool, which also helps you manage your health better.

5e00f99225dcbd3eeea4f31d,GE Healthcare,UP49,Software,Healthcare & Biomedical Devices,Early Prediction of Sepsis from Clinical Data,"The goal of this Challenge is the early detection of sepsis using physiological data. For the purpose of the Challenge, defined sepsis according to the Sepsis3 guidelines, i.e., a twopoint change in the patient's Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score and clinical suspicion of infection (as defined by the ordering of blood cultures or IV antibiotics) (Singer et al., 2016).The early prediction of sepsis is potentially lifesaving, and challenging participants to predict sepsis 6 hours before the clinical prediction of sepsis. Conversely, the late prediction of sepsis is potentially lifethreatening, and predicting sepsis in nonsepsis patients (or predicting sepsis very early in sepsis patients) consumes limited hospital resources.Develop a digital solution that uses artificial intelligence to detect patient deterioration before its too late and trigger notifications to clinicians and care teams. Train healthcare providers and frontline staff to quickly recognize symptoms to identify sepsis and treat patients at the earliest. Also, educate preventing infections in health care settings and in the community so that infections that can lead to sepsis can be stopped before they happen. Provide guidelines to follow infection control requirements (e.g., Hand hygiene) and ensure one to receive recommended vaccines (e.g., Flu and pneumococcal, etc.).AbstractSepsis is a lifethreatening condition that occurs when the body's response to infection causes tissue damage, organ failure, or death (Singer et al., 2016). In the U.S., nearly 1.7 million people develop sepsis and 270,000 people die from sepsis each year; over one third of people who die in U.S. hospitals have sepsis (CDC). Internationally, an estimated 30 million people develop sepsis and 6 million people die from sepsis each year; an estimated 4.2 million newborns and children are affected (WHO). Sepsis costs U.S. hospitals more than any other health condition at 24 billion (13 of U.S. healthcare expenses) a year, and a majority of these costs are for sepsis patients that were not diagnosed at admission (Paoli et al., 2018). Sepsis costs are even greater globally with the developing world at most risk. Altogether, sepsis is a major public health issue responsible for significant morbidity, mortality, and healthcare expenses.Early detection and antibiotic treatment of sepsis are critical for improving sepsis outcomes, where each hour of delayed treatment has been associated with roughly an 48 increase in mortality (Kumar et al., 2006; Seymour et al., 2017). To help address this problem, clinicians have proposed new definitions for sepsis (Singer et al., 2016), but the fundamental need to detect and treat sepsis early still remains, and basic questions about the limits of early detection remain unanswered. data set https://physionet.org/content/challenge2019/1.0.0/","

The excavator uses a Hydraulic system to generate a Hydraulic force to control the mechanical arm of the machine. It also uses a crawler system for its movement.The main sections of an excavator are the undercarriage assembly, revolving frame assy. The undercarriage assembly includes tracks, track frame, and final drives, which have a hydraulic motor and gearing providing the drive to the individual tracks. The revolving frame assembly includes the operator cab, counterweight, engine, fuel and hydraulic oil tanks and work attachment of boom, arm  bucket its actuating cylinders, the swing system has swing machinery of gearbox and driving swing motors with hydrostatic primary brake and parking brake as secondary for safe operation of excavator. The hydraulic control system is actuated by operator sitting in operator cabin seat with Hydraulic joystick.  The revolving structure attaches to the undercarriage by way of slewing bearing system. High pressure oil is supplied to the tracks of hydraulic motors through a hydraulic swivel  joint at the axis of the swing center, allowing the machine to slew 360 unhindered and thus provides the leftandright movement.Saving energy of construction machinery, especially the hydraulic excavator is very essential. The development of new energy saving solutions and efficient hydraulic system have become a priority for OEM's.When hydraulic excavators lower their boom or brake the rotating upper structure, recoverable potential or kinetic energy is available.

With proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) devices and sensor. Cisco can play a big role automating alerts and actions in buildings, campuses or cities. Student teams are expected to develop a protocol to have a communication with the IoT sensors and transfer the relevant data. Solution Expected: Build a multiprotocol application would truly help realize the vision of IoT with devices that span across use cases and cost points, and deliver meaningful impact on social initiatives such as Swachh Bharat One such example could be the following: a smart garbage sensor connecting over a LoRa protocol to the wireless Access Point and a Docker based application executing on the Access Point sensing that the garbage can may be full and needs attention. Upon making such an inference, the application may choose to unlock a Zigbee lock attached to the door as well as turning on a Zigbee light in the location closest to the garbage bin. Such a multiprotocol application would truly help realize the vision of IoT with devices that span across use cases and cost points, and deliver meaningful impact on social initiatives such as Swachh Bharat Tech recommendation: Cisco latest generation of WiFi 6 access points  the Catalyst 9120 is truly multilingual with diverse radio capabilities to address the needs of a fragmented world of IoT protocols.

Serving 120,000,000 children in over 1,265,000 schools and Education Guarantee Scheme centers, it is the largest of its kind in the world. Student teams are expected to build machine vision solution to monitor the activities under the Midday Meal Scheme.Solution Expected:As the MidDay Meal program runs in schools across the country, continuous auditing and monitoring of the program might be challenging.Typical Auditing and Monitoring could involve:Ensuring number of students that took meal is same number reported. Lunch served is same as published/reported menu. Alerting in case of discrepancy and capability to centrally see past records / proof (numbers and visual) for any school. To design modules based on the above mentioned activities, video feed shall be provided to the student teams. These feeds shall come from the Meraki security camera. Typically, these shall come from the actual / imitated site i.e. schools, food serving area etc. Student teams are expected to explore the capabilities of Meraki cameras inbuilt Machine learning (ML) modules and develop solutions around it. E.g. counting students, object recognition etc. Meraki security camera also has an inbuilt functionality to capture snapshot photos. Teams are expected to generate their own database based on the region of interest and features they wish to extract to develop ML models. Along with the expectations of Auditing  Monitoring the student teams should also propose innovative ideas (backed with research) to extract additional information from above snapshots / photos.

Helicopter Turboprops are the propellers having propulsion system mounted at tip of the blades. The major idea about this is to reduce the travel cost per passenger as turbo props are more efficient, provide high endurance than that of the normal helicopter blades and provides two times the speed to the plane. On the other hand unbearable noise is one of the issue in helicopter turboprops. In this problem statement, students are supposed to make the working prototype of helicopter turboprops. These propellers should be designed in such a way that, it should lift and land a foam model of an aircraft weighing 700 grams. Successful flight test of the same is mandatory for the completion of the project.","

There are 2 Cast Houses and 1 Rolling Plant as well. Hot metal is tapped through Tapping Ladles from 960 pots and then transferred into transport ladles on the metal transporting trucks (MTT) for delivery to the desired Cast House Location as per the requisition made by the individual Cast Houses and Rolling Plant.N.B:<ul><li>Maximum 16 nos. of trucks can be deployed in the Pot Rooms.</li><li>The liquid metal is tapped at around 960C.</li><li>The Cast House desired temperature range for metal casting 720C760C.</li><li>If the metal arrives at little above the casting temperature value then it is ready for casting and no fuel is required to be burnt in the metal holding casting furnaces.</li></ul>Operation:A.Cast HouseA (Operation) prepares Metal Planning Schedule for 04 shifts on daily basis and forwards Hard/Soft Copy to Pot Line (Operation).B.After receipt of the metal planning schedule the Pot Line (Operation) shiftincharge prepares tapping schedule for his shift.C.From the tapping schedule ladle schedule is derived along with the metal dispatch against requirement by Cast House (Operation).D.Accordingly MTT deployment by the Pot Line (Operation) transport section is arranged for each Pot Line Room Location to the respective Cast House in a MerrygoRound fashion during the shift hours.E.Normally Cast HouseB and Rolling Plant forward their shift wise ladle requirement, in terms of no. of ladles required by them in a shift, initially to the Transport Section of Pot Line (Operation).F.Balance left out hot metal available is dispatched to Cast HouseA along with any adjustment required for handling of no. of ladles available with Pot Line (Operation) arising out of additional requirement raised or surplus metal available from Cast HouseB and Rolling Plant Shops due to operational issues.G.Shift wise hot metal reconciliation between Pot Line (Operation) and Cast House is carried out on daily basis to tally the records with the quantity of the metal dispatched and received by the Cast House during the day against the metal planning made.Problems:The entire operation is manual as of now. There is no single window available for operation and coordination job. The transit time required between demand and supply involves various factors such as trip length, information on availability of vehicle, tracking of vehicle location. As a result, trucks may arrive later than the demanded time resulting in drop of loaded ladle metal temperature. All this leads to wastage of heat energy, longer wait time and longer metal truck haulage at times.Moreover, Data portability, processing and reporting, all are manual. Hence a need for IOT based vehicle mounted pilot project which will save energy, time, etc. and help us greatly in avoiding chaos situations.Improvements Desired:To devise an IOT based vehicle mounted pilot project which shall ensure real time data connectivity on:Vehicle location tracking through LPS. (UWB  / RTLS / IndoorLocating / LPS)Information on availability of vehicle.Live metal temperature data from ladle.Vehicle call request with location.Driver acknowledgement for call request.Vehicle identification through code broadcast.The proposed project will enable to achieve the following:Reduced Metal Transporting Trucks turnaround time leading to lower haulage losses.Reduced occurrences of ladle hot metal temperature drop due to smaller and faster haulage time.More efficient control of vehicle logistics reducing chaos due to vehicle unavailability/in traceability.Reduction of possibility of metal outage at either of Cast Houses, Rolling Plant.Reduction in consumption of fuel oil required for reheating of liquid metal.","

Smart grids which integrate both conventional energy sources and renewable sources are envisioned to be a sustainable power generation solution. However, all sources of renewable energy are affected by environmental factors (such as wind speed, intensity of solar radiation, cloud cover) which causes fluctuations in power generated from these sources. Also, the availability are subjected to daily/annual cycles (eg. Solar energy available during daytime only). While smart metering enables realtime demand forecasting; accurate models that forecast power generated by renewable energy sources are also needed.  Accurate forecasting models will ensure grid stability, smooth scheduling and energy management.  For instance, if the model forecasts renewable energy outage for a certain duration of time, the smart grid must seamlessly switch to the conventional energy source for that duration and ensure that the generated power meets the demand forecast.  Literature proposes various learningbased forecasting models for renewable energy sources based on open data sources; as well as scheduling strategies for demandsupply matching. Further, simulation software to realistically model microgrids are also available. The problem defined here is to come up with a framework which: realistically simulates a microgrid; forecasts demand and supply of (renewable) energy; seamlessly schedules supply of renewable (and conventional energy) to meet the demand; and provides actionable insights about the functioning of the smart grid system.PROBLEM STATEMENT:<ul><li>Simulate the microgrid/utility system with various consumers and prosumers.</li><li>For the renewable energy sources, using environment time series data from open data forumsdevelop energy generation forecasting models.</li><li>For the consumers/prosumers using energy consumption time series data from open data forumsdevelop energy demand forecasting models.</li><li>Develop scheduling algorithms for the utility/microgrid controller.</li><li>Integrate the forecasting model and scheduler with the simulation setup in 1.</li><li>Prototype the following use case with developed models:</li></ul>An Integrated Smart Grid utility manager would want to remotely monitor the operations of the deployed system in realtime.

When stored in tanks, these fluids tend to stick inside the tanks forming layers of semisolid substance. Moreover, many impurities of these fluids settle down and stick to the surface of the tanks. It is therefore imperative that the tanks are cleaned on a regular basis on ships.Generally, tanks cleaning on the ship is done during dry dock and whenever the inspection of the tanks is due. Cleaning is done for inspection or if there is any work to be done inside the tanks such as cracks, leaks, etc.Tank cleaning inspection and repairs is a necessary procedure performed on board ships. This process, when carried out by humans, tends to be hazardous, sometimes leading to explosion and accidents. In spite of all the necessary safety precautions and enclosed space entry procedures, accidents still occur while inspecting, cleaning and repairing tanks on board ships.(b)How it is being Overcome.The problem is, at present, being overcome by ventilating the tanks and use of personnel protective gears. However, the atmosphere in the tanks still remains unsatisfactory and continues to pose health hazards for human beings.The following procedure is followed before making an entry for tank cleaning: <ul><li>Fluid Contents of the tank should be removed as practicable as possible and stripped thoroughly before entering.</li><li>Ventilate the tank using thorough ventilation or forced ventilation method and make the tank suitable for man entry.</li><li>Before making a man entry, the atmosphere of the tank is tested for percentage of oxygen and availability of any toxic gases. This has to be done using remote access if possible, otherwise the person entering the tank for testing atmosphere must wear a breathing apparatus.</li><li>Various levels and compartments of tank is tested for the percentage of oxygen and availability of toxic gases. A multi gas analyser is used and a person who is trained and has the knowledge of using such equipment carries out the inspection.</li></ul>Once the tank is found safe for man entry, workers enter the tank and carry out cleaning, inspection, repairs etc. Working within these constrained spaces is hazardous, in spite of all the safety precautions.<ul><li>Why it is Important to Solve.</li></ul>Effective solution of this problem is critical to avoid(a)time delays in inspecting, cleaning and repairing tanks(b)accidents which still occur inside the tanks on board ships.(c)manpower cost.<ul><li>Suggested Solutions.</li></ul>The problem can be resolved by developing a mechanism like a robotic arm with the following attachments:(a)Gas analyser for checking the percentage of oxygen and presence of toxic gases,(b)Camera for inspection of tank and examination of defect.(c)Cleaning Attachment(d)Repair attachments(e)Quality Inspection EquipmentThe robotic arm should be amenable for reliable operation on a ship and capable of entering the tanks and reaching all areas within. It should have programmable operations like horizontal movement, vertical movement, speed adjustment, single or multistage operation at any desired length and angle range, etc. It should be light enough to carry within the constraints of a ship, with fixing arrangements that match with arrangements onboard ship.","

Renewable energy business is up and running Internet of Things (IoT) plays an important role in these dynamics. Internet of Things economy is expected to gain another 43 by 2022 according to International Energy Agency.As simple as they look, wind turbines are extremely complex constructions often placed in wild conditionsopen sea and faraway fields. In order to stay efficient and work at full potential, wind farms should be able to promptly adjust to the changing environment. Not to mention the importance of timely maintenance. IoT and energy solutionssensorbased technology, analytics for important datum on weather and environment condition and turbine health including blade ejection due to loosening of the bolts. help automate the management of wind farms, optimize maintenance and thus reduce the cost dramatically.Explain the general problem statement in simple terms.<ul><li>Maximize the Turbine Power Generation</li><li>Unavailability of real time data from wind turbines</li><li>Delayed detection of mechanical and structural faults</li><li>Delayed order placements of spares/replacements</li><li>Reliance on manual inspection of every turbine</li></ul>The users of this system are twofold:The distribution utility manager wants to monitor all the electrical wind turbine /transformers, so that he can maximize the turbine power generation. He wanted to track the real time health of all parts of turbine including generator, blades etc., live parameters monitored such as wind direction , temperature, current, voltage etc. on a geographical map, so that he can assign a repair crew member to resolve the issue on the open notification.The manager also wants to know the historical information to all the parameters being monitored to analyze the root cause of the failure and to predict the future outages. He also wants analytical dashboards which helps in the decision making process. However, the manager wants to make his decisions as per the smart data available i.e. live sensor data, historical sensor data, device metadataTechnology that can address this issue partially.SAP Leonardo with S/4 Digital CoreSince SAP Leonardo site on top of S/4 HANA, it easily integrates with S/4 Digital Core so that it will start reading Wind Turbine real time sensor data at one side and processing business transactions and applications at other. SAP Leonardo enables users to receive instant notifications of any failure events happening at Turbine Tower.When any issue rises such as oil leakage or break down, Leonardo will search for extra available spare part from S/4 Digital Cores Warehouse Management Component.If a spare part exists in the S/4 warehouse, Leonardo will process a PTO (Pick Transfer Order) and assign a work order to nearest technician to a tower using his/her GPS coordinates. A technician will pick up the spare part from warehouse and fix the turbine issue.In case if Leonardo does not find spare part in S/4 Warehouse Component, it will automatically place a Purchase Order to a Vendor and maintain its record in a custom Z table.Once a factory user performs a GR (Goods Receive) for spare part through SAP tcode MIGO, Leonardo will check its existence in custom created Z table  if found, it will automatically create and assign a new work order to a technician.This integrated automation will drastically save time for troubleshooting  maximize the Turbine Power generationDesired Outcome:<ul><li>Cost efficiency in maintaining and servicing wind turbines</li><li>Immediate order placement in case of inventory exhaustion.</li><li>To maintain the desired power output from wind farm to grid</li><li>Maximize the Turbine Power Generation</li><li>Real time insights of mechanical failures in wind turbines</li><li>Data Analysis of downtime and its causes</li><li>Pattern analysis thereby enabling better forecast</li></ul>","

Ltd,MS452,Hardware,Smart Communication,"Designing devices, which would help in easing communication channels between various communication devices and points.","A truly digital public transportation system for buses, trains and feeder servicesExplain the general problem statement in simple terms.v)As the population in city grows multifold year on year the commuting times continue to grow. Whether you commute by train (metro/nonmetro), bus, smart bike or on feeder services there is no one stop shop for planning your trip using public transport facilities.vi)With raising traffic both road and rail, there is no mechanism to track the arrival / departure times, shift between different modes of transport etc.vii)Today, the user of public transport facility has to shift between two modes of transport on an average (a train and a bus / a bus and a feeder service to the nearby work location). The uncertainty of when these services are available and how crowded it would be makes it hard plan the trip accordingly.viii)From a government point of view, without knowing the demand at various times, it makes it hard for them to increase / decrease these services for full utilization. Hence, it is important to gauge the demand.The users of this system are twofold:User / Traveler: An end user who uses the public transport services to plan a trip;Government Authorities: Assess and provide the services according to the need of the users and manage the services based on the demand.Technology that can address this issueiv)A unified system that brings all modes of public transport data into a single source of truth.v)A mobile app and website for end users to plan and book travel across multiple public transport facilities railways, bus, metro and feeder services.vi)GPS sensors on buses, trains, feeder services where feasible and processing capabilityvii)Payments interface to enable direct payment for the entire trip (that can be scanned for validity at the public transport being used)Technology platform recommendationi)A cloud database with extensible featuresii)A distributed database with scalability featuresiii)Microservice orchestration platform for API integration ( Maps, regional data )iv)On cloud UX for creating a native Appv)Leverage SMS API gatewayvi)Leverage ready apps from Azure or AWSAn example comparison of these services:In the UK you can manage all the local commute using the railways using National Rail app. This App is a onestopshop for users for both trains, London metro tubes, buses etc. An user can plan end to end services using this App.For our idea, some of the key customer journeys envisaged using this are.i)Fetch schedule times of the buses / trains / feeder services individuallyii)Book your journeyiii)Bar code based identification of tickets purchasediv)Real time tracking of your service (bus / train) and identify the ETA to reach your destinationv)Set up alerts for your servicevi)Send notifications based on channel of choice (SMS / App notifications)Desired Outcome:iv)Usera.Provide a seamless, onestop, endtoend experience when planning any tripb.Show all available options to the user from which he can pick which ones he prefersc.No waiting queue at the availed service facility.d.Make bookings/reservations within this service and pay in total the entire amountv)Governmenta.Promote/boost railways, state bus transport corporations, suburban railway, metrob.In the long run, this service can replace state wise bus transport reservation websites with a single website/app leading to huge cost savingsc.Additional source of revenue in the form of small commission amounts per transactiond.Provide a major source of data as the service becomes more popular which can help the Govt. to plan for roads/railways/infrastructure development in the futuree.Help more transport based entrepreneurs and small businesses to bring their services to the public faster","

SAR operations aim at finding missing objects with minimum time in a determined area. There are fundamentally two problems in these operations. The first problem is assessing highly reliable probability distribution maps, and the second is determining the search pattern that sweeps the area from the air as fast as possible. SAR operations benefit greatly from the GIS technology. The area, determined by the search planner, that is to be searched is called Search Area. This area may be subdivided into search subareas for the purpose of assigning specific responsibilities to the available search facilities. The International Aeronautical and Maritime Search and Rescue Manual (IAMSAR) Vol. II (ICAO DOC 9731) provides all necessary information and guidance. Projecs intends to achive:  Determining the size of the search area from the Last Known Position (LKP), including speed, heading and attitude, of aircraft.<ul><li>Determining the desired area coverage</li><li>Selecting appropriate search patterns.</li></ul>","

5e00fa83b13f24e35733b3e0,Department of Atomic Energy,PC85,Hardware,Smart Communication,Laser based Vibration Sensor operated through mobile,"Vibration detection plays an important role in the different areas of structural health monitoring and industrial engineering. If the vibration increases above the permissible limits, it might lead to the failure of these structures and machines. Thus, it is very important to continuously monitor the vibration of a critical structure or machine. Vibration can be expressed in terms of its amplitude and frequency. Laser based vibration measurement has gained importance due to its noncontact, nondestructive nature and fast speed. Laser Vibrometer is based on optical triangulation technique. In Triangulation technique for vibration measurement, visible laser beam emitted from a diode laser strikes the target and the backscattered light is collected by suitable optics to focus on a position sensitive detector (PSD). Laser source, target and focusing optics form a triangle. The position of focused spot on the detector is related to the distance of the target from the sensor thus displacement of focused spot on detector is related to the displacement of the target from its equilibrium position. The PSD converts optical signal into electrical signal. Thus a vibration displacement signal in electrical form is generated by the sensor, which corresponds to mechanical vibration of the target. For simple harmonic motion, an optical triangulation based displacement sensors generate a sinusoidal signal whose frequency corresponds to frequency of vibration.Laser vibrometer uses low power Laser diode as light source. The instrument consists in two partsI.Sensor, consisting of Laser light source (Diode Laser), optical system (Focusing lens) to collect the backscattered light after it has interacted with the object, detection system consisting of optoelectronic device (PSD) and analog electronic circuit to process the detector output and generate 5V output corresponding to 5 mm displacement of the object. This analog voltage is to be digitized and then transmitted using blue tooth technology to the nearest mobile phone.II.An application program on mobile phone will receive the dynamic displacement data from laser sensor and computes the FFT of the signal. This calculated FFT spectrum will carry the amplitude and frequency contents of the vibration. The calculated frequency spectrum is to be displayed in graphical form on the mobile screen and important parameters like dominant frequencies and their amplitude will be extracted from the spectrum and separately displayed.Thus the problem consists of development of compact laser sensor with wireless transmission capability, battery operated and size of the palm for vibration measurement. Then development of suitable Android based  mobile app to communicate to the sensor and display frequency spectrum and important vibration parameters on mobile screen.","

In order to facilitate this, the patient isassumed to be located in a coordinate system refered to as the PatientCoordinate System(PCS), whereas the surgeon has access to preoperativemedical scans(like CT/MRI etc.) of the subject in the coordinate system referedto as the Image Coordinate System(ICS). Any procedure planned in medicalscans under ICS can be transfered to patient domain by utilizing this mapping.The challenge of accurately establishing this mapping (or registration)between PCS and ICS plays a critical role in influencing the reliability of thesurgery procedure itself.

A Mobile AdhocNETworking(MANET) protocol based on device geographical location information is conceptualized to serve as a gate way device. Problem is coding, simulation and testing of scalability. A network routing protocol is scalable in terms of number of nodes when it can accommodate additional nodes without increase of overhead for given limited area. The conceptualizedMANET protocolshall establish the source to destination path similar to zone routing protocols (ZRP). The path to destination is referred at source, in terms of the geological zones therefore allowing movement of intermediate mobile devices across path without disturbing the path. The devices get assigned new zone automatically using the GPS. The simulation scenario shall be source node is searching a path to friendly destination device, exchange data (hello) and drop the link. The devices follow random mobility pattern in 2 D frame. For searching of devices there is pre condition of knowing past history or pattern or set of fixed zones where destination node can reside. This is close to real world scenario where destinations reside at known zonessuch as home, office, commutation route, friends place, entertainment hub in area, railway station, airport etc. The MANET protocol, by nature of precondition, of knowing the possibility of location of devices; protects from spam connection and un authorized network broadcast. It is allowed ato modify the protocol to certain level to improve security, privacy without diluting the basic principal. The simulation is required to test the claim of scalability level in terms of N devices in simulation. A set of software codes will be required to be developed for simulation of the routing protocol.The simulation can be done using open source network simulator. It is required to test and simulate the concept of this routing protocol and its scalability. The metric of scalability will be success in search, establish and dropping the links between pairs of devices and amount of information shared when not having links. The largest possible MANET size is required to be order of 1000s. All MANET devices shall be interchangeable and there will not be any infrastructure dedicated node. All devise shall be replaceable without affecting MANET performance. Fixed location nodes can be used.An example application can be MANET for police cars or disaster relief providers to enable connectivity in them without having to connect to any public network.""","

5e00fa83b13f24e35733b3e3,Department of Atomic Energy,PC88,Hardware,Healthcare & Biomedical Devices,Generalized Epileptic Seizure Alert System,"Epilepsy is a central nervous system (neurological) disorder in which brain activity becomes abnormal, causing seizures or periods of unusual behavior, sensations, and sometimes loss of awareness.Of the 70 million persons with epilepsy (PWE) worldwide, nearly 12 million PWE are expected to reside in India; which contributes to nearly onesixth of the global burden. Epilepsy often manifests itself in childhood and is a cause of immense concern for the parents who are often kept on their toes anticipating the next seizure event. This causes psychological and health concerns amongst the primary caregivers who often stay awake through the night in anticipation.Seizures are of many kind with the most prevalent being generalized tonicclonic seizure A generalized tonicclonic seizure, sometimes called a grand mal seizure, is a disturbance in the functioning of both sides of the brain. This disturbance is caused by electrical signals spreading through the brain inappropriately. Often this will result in signals being sent to the muscles, nerves, or glands. The spread of these signals in the brain can make one lose consciousness and have severe muscle contractions.The aim of this project is to develop a battery powered, low cost,portable generalized tonicclonic seizure alert device which can notify nearby family or caregivers when a seizure occurs through alarms, phone calls or text alerts, depending on the device. A caregiver can then help the person during and after the seizure. For example, they can help reposition the person, making sure they are on their side if they are not conscious. They can also make sure someone doesnt fall asleep on their stomach afterwards. If breathing or other problems occur, they can call for medical help. They may also be able to give rescue medications or call for an ambulance if the seizure lasts too long or the person has repeated seizures.The project aims at using Inertial Measurement Unit/tri axial accelerometer as the primary sensing unit coupled with advanced signal processing and machine learning techniques to detect abnormal motions akin to seizures in the patients body.The proposed instrument shall also consist of heartbeat monitoring system for additional analytics related to sleep quality monitoring. The project has significant hardware and software challenges which includes accurate measurement and classification of jerking motions,continuous low power heart rate monitoring, signal processing and machine learning algorithms at a very low power budget. The proposed device will reduce burden on the primary caregivers or family members who often spend sleepless nights anticipating the seizure event.","

5e00fa83b13f24e35733b3e4,Department of Atomic Energy,PC89,Hardware,Security & Surveillance,Digital Imaging of Objects behind Steel walls,"Steel is widely used material for fabrication of machinery and equipments in almost all the industries. Maintenance of these equipments may become very expensive and time consuming if it requires deassembling, inspection and then reassembling. So, an innovative technology can be developed which will help in machinery inspection in assembled condition by digitally imaging all the objects inside it like XRays for human body. This will help in identifying the cause of the malfunction of the machinery and necessary action can be taken.Solution methodologyLight waves can pass through glass walls and reflect from the objects behind it. This makes us able to see through a glass wall. Similarly, some other EM waves can pass through concrete walls. There are already many technological developments going on worldwide to use this fact to locate objects behind the concrete walls. Even, moving human body can be detected behind concrete wall upto certain distance using available technology.As EM waves cannot pass through steel walls, use of sound waves/ultrasound can be explored. Instrumentation developed (both software and hardware) should be able to detect either the sound waves generated behind steel wall or send a known sound pulse and get its echo reflected from the objects behind the wall. Developed technology can be envisaged as the multiple microphones mounted on many locations on the machinery to detect and locate the position of the object generating sound.Final outcomeA set of compatible hardware and software is to be developed which will be able to detect and locate either the source of sound or create a digital imaging of all the objects behind the steel wall. There should be provision of adjusting the frequency transmitted and received by sensors to consider varying thickness of the wall and material of objects behind it.ChallengesSince wave propagation inside the machinery involves very little distance, time difference obtained from various objects behind the steel wall is supposed to be very less. It will be very difficult to detect and differentiate the sound signal obtained from the objects. Advances signal processing technique will be required to be developed to accomplish this task.","

Without comprehensive research, all stages that follow in research activities could be greatly affected. Finding the required information for research can be difficult as the resources and information on internet and otherwise are often located in dispersed places, and accessing the right content can be time consuming.In this context, a single State research portal is needed to be designed in a manner that it can serve as a onestop research portal for all the State Universities and colleges comprising the essential areas/parameters. Few of the areas to be incorporated are as given below:a.Navigating to information: It should be built on user experience best practices. As researchers are used to accessing websites (whether in their personal or professional lives) that respond to their screen size and are optimized for mobile, but also contain ideal user experience elements to make it easy to navigate (think single search bar front and center, clear organization of content etc.).b.Uploading research, discovery of and access to information:  It should be a userfriendly research portal wherein the researchers can search and discover the right information and content for their work. They also be able to upload their research work university/college/miscellaneous wise which may further be categorized department/areas of study wise.A discovery service is the next tool to consider integrating into research portal. Consider how metadata is used, the methodology around searching and retrieving search results, how the tool anticipates users needs, and what can be integrated into the discovery tool.c.Authentication: As research and collection of information resources become increasingly digital, authentication will be a key component to ensure the security of users and their content. For example, your collection may offer users access to various publisher or research platforms/portals that all have varying requirements for authentication. Entry into these resources is expected to be seamless and intuitive by researchers.","

The manpower requirements for effectively carrying out such an important exercise is very high keeping in view large number of embankment protection works across river networks which are not easily accessible at times. Therefore, preventive maintenance of embankments needs a technological solutioninvolving participation of localsto safeguard the public property and life.One such solution may be through the use of embankment mapping and crowdsourced health card. Embankment mapping involves the development of GIS application to analyse the existing river embankment network. The crowd sourced data with images, geolocation and time stamp can be used for the generation of health card of embankment and identifying the critical sections thereof for their preventive maintenance.","

Information regarding area under various crops is generally available at an aggregate level e.g. district wise cultivated area under individual crops. Nonavailability ofactual crop maps preventsspatial visualisation of water utilisation and therefore proper water accounting. National Remote Sensing Centre (NRSC), Hyderabad generates yearly Land Use Land Cover (LULC) maps at a finer resolution of 56m containing land use classes of crop season and number of crops (single/multiple crop). Crowdsourced information from farmers, agricultural extension service providers, local administration and local population may be used for generation of crop type maps for a particular irrigation season which in turn may be used for preparation of water accounts at various spatial scales rangingfrom command of a major to minor irrigation project. Water Accounting at various spatial and temporal scales in commands of irrigation projects will help in informed decision making during the ensuing crop season and leads to optimal utilisation of irrigation water.","

The data received is analyzed to monitor the exceedances against the prescribed standards for each industry. APPCB looks forward to bringing in all polluting industries in the state to enhance the existing system more transparent and effective monitoring of emissions and effluents.As an extensively modernizing state, Andhra Pradesh is developing its industrial sector vigorously. Industries being significant source of both emission and effluents, are required to be monitored stringent monitoring.APPCB uses monitoring tools namely Continuous Emission Monitoring System (CEMS) and Continuous Effluent Quality Monitoring System (CEQMS) to check release of polluting emission and effluent to the environment. CEMS and CEQMS comprises analytical components and are continuous real time tools, providing monitoring data every minute.Although there is a system of real time monitoring of polluting emissions and effluents from industries, APPCB is trying to develop a more efficient system that can provide authentic Continuous Emission Monitoring System (CEMS) and Continuous Effluent Quality Monitoring System (CEQMS). CEMS and CEQMS are calibrated in such a way that it collates data from different types of industries falling under different make and model as well as pollution category. Since each industrial sector under each pollution category may have set emission and effluent standards as prescribed by Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) or standardized by APPCB as per the local environmental conditions, ensuring reliability and consistency of the data received through CEMS and CEQMS are important.Other areas of improvement for implementation of CEMS/CEQMS are as follows: Ensuring quality assurance of equipment and suitable technology, most reliable method of installation of analyzers, effectual reliable operation, ensuring credible data, viable data transfer calibration and maintenance of the equipment etc.Additionally, enhancement of the existing online monitoring system is also required for development of an unswerving emission and effluent database for the state of Andhra Pradesh. Above mentioned are the need of the hour for Andhra Pradesh state as 13 town/cities in the state are already listed in the list of NonAttainment cities w.r.t air pollution and five river stretches are categorized as polluted. It is crucial for APPCB as the key regulatory agency for pollution in the state.Current System using in detailed:Andhra Pradesh Pollution Control Board uses cloudbased software to connect all the analyzers installed at the industries to obtain real time data. The data received is analyzed to monitor the exceedances against the prescribed standards for each industry. APPCB looks forward to bringing in all polluting industry categories existing in the state to be adequately monitored to check pollution in the long run.Significant indicators taken into consideration under CEMS are the emission and effluent quality standard limits as prescribed by the Board based on the industry type, category, local conditions and the characteristics of the emission and effluents by the industry.APPCB envisages implementing Internet of Things (loT) technology for obtaining of authentic and reliable data directly from the analyzers installed at the industry rather than the data from the intermediary system.","

The mixture thus produced acquires a physical state of emulsion.Solution If there can be an AUTOMATIC BASTI BLENDER for crushing and blending basti or enema ingredients with base/bowl  made of wood/metal/ceramic/granite with heavy pestle connected to machine that rotates automatically around the base at a specific speedThere should be separate sections of main 5 ingredients i.e, honey, salt, oil, paste of drug and decoction of drug.The automatic blender should be pre programmed for each ingredient to be instilled into the bowl/mortar in a specific measurable amount ( as per the percentage of each ingredient required in the final product) automatically at a specific interval with the help of a set self timer attched into it.This will not only help making Basti/ Enema conveniently but also will  prevent individual differences in final Basti by making a standard final manufactured Basti.","

The improvement to such systems is explained herein below:</li></ul>(5.1) current scenario  the color feeding systems to the printing machines is manual in nature. This results in wastage of expensive printing colors by 25 to 30 as the process is dependent on human intervention. Apart from the wastage aspect, there is also more water required for washing which not only leads to higher costs, but has an adverse environmental impact.(5.2) proposed changes the industry is exploring design of an auto color feeding system, using pneumatic or gear based pumps. This will lead to reduced wastage, lesser use of water and meeting environmental compliances<ul><li>An RD facility would be needed in Surat in order to carry out the necessary development as suggested above and come up with firm findings on which system would be better for commercialization.</li><li>The following graph shows the revenue projection of Indias technical textile machine manufacturing market till 2018</li></ul>","

Need for good patient care in hospitals, assessment and management of fluid and electrolyte is the most fundamental thing required. All most in all hospital, an assist/nurse is responsible for monitoring the electrolytes bottle level. But unfortunately most of the time, the observer may forget to change the bottle at correct time due to their busy schedule.To overcome this critical situation, a IoT based automatic alerting and indicating device is proposed where sensor is used as a level sensor or weight sensor. It is based on the principle that the sensor output changes when fluid level/weight is below certain limit. When Fluid level/weight is low, will alerts the observer through the display or/and mobile phone at the control room indicates the room number of the patient for quick recovery Hospital uses simple electrolytes bottles with no indication, it may create a problem to patient because the reverse flow will start, blood start to flow from body towards bottle. In, Hospital ICU, CCU, NICU, OPD, OT, most of all department of hospital required such kind of automatic monitoring and indication system. Also Health care industries will one of the users. such monitoring system can be useful in small , medium and large size of hospitals and also it useful during home care. If such a monitoring system builds, it will decrease the chances of patients hazards and increases the accuracy of health care in hospital. In future we can design a ready mate portable cover system for such bottle. Ready mate Wearable sensors on sides of bottle can detect level/weight offluid inside bottles. Such data can also send to nurses and/or doctors mobile and they can start or stop the fluid and also monitoring fluid condition, such things required security password also. Hospital staff, the constant need to manually monitor the level of bottles is avoided. This is of high advantage to the patients especially during night times. This system also avoids the fatal risk of air bubbles entering the patients bloodstream, which is a serious threat as air bubbles in blood can cause immediate death. Such a device will create assurity of nonharm condition to patients. and also helpful to monitoring of data and such data can be stored and will be useful in future.","

The objective of this study was to review and synthesize concepts and techniques of flood hazard, vulnerability and risk assessment with reference to the Uttarakhad. Using geo spatial technology to model and predict the magnitude of flood risk areas, Geographic Information System (GIS) analysis techniques are used for this study the flooding causative factors such as rainfall distribution, elevation and slope, drainage network and density. This study aims at providing expertise for preparing flood mapping and estimating flood risks in growing urban areas.GIS and remote sensing play an important role in flood hazard, vulnerability and in risk assessment and useful for delineation of flood zones, preparation of flood hazard and risk maps The main advantage of using GIS for flood analyses is that it not only generates a visualization of flooding, but also creates potential to further analyze these events to estimate probable damage due to floods. Compared to traditional mapping, GIS enables the comparisons across spatial units; comparison across different themes by category of hazards and disasters; merging of qualitative with qualitative assessment and spatial database, based on which logical and/or numerical operations can be dynamically performed. These are grounds for concluding that GIS has an important function to play in natural hazards analyses because natural hazards are multidimensional phenomena, which have a spatial component.","

A large amount of money is going to waste due to irregularity and improper approach. Sound asset management principles need to be introduced as an integral part of road policies and maintenance program. Comprehensive maintenance planning with schedule,institutional reforms, linkage with initial construction, maintenance backlog, utilization of fund, regular on site inspections, training to the workforce, human attitude, existing practices and knowledge of different road patterns are the major challenges in recordkeeping. The maintenance and record keeping of maintenance is the key issues in the government department after the liability period over of new construction. A comprehensive system will help for planning of maintenance schedule, frame work, methodology. Also a prediction can be made for the timely maintenance fund requirements. Effective techniques can be decided for the problems. Quality of initial construction work can be achieved. It is more important to say that wastage of public fund can be reduced from the repetitive approach. Mostly, Public infrastructure is developed by the government department. It is obvious that various government bodies like municipalities, nagarpalika, panchayat and road and building department of state and central government etc. will be the potential users. Also private residential and commercial communities may use it for the maintenance records and fund estimation. A comprehensive maintenance recordkeeping system will be the ready tool, which serve different aspects of complete qualitative maintenance such as, data base of complete any type of inspection onsite, recording defects including capture of images and location data to aid in repair, repair methodology applied, cost of maintenance, effective area of work, frequency of maintenance including during liability period of new constructions and fund planning for the future. It will be fruitful for the executors for social and economic development of users. Effective maintenance record keeping system will create social and economic impacts of rural roads users. It will serves ready record for long term budget planning as huge investment incurred in road infrastructure development. Some qualitative outputs such as, maintained roads provide access to where people live and important facilities such as markets, schools and health services. Good access provides the opportunity for improving livelihoods and increased employment opportunities, thereby contributing to the alleviation of poverty. Although it may be argued that the link between rural roads and poverty alleviation is mostly indirect, experience clearly shows that areas with poor road access are generally more disadvantaged than areas that are better served. The web application will contain an effective dashboard (visualization like a BI tool) which will provide different kinds of analysis , in order to take quick actions and to avoid spending excessive time in analysing this information. The application will be an effective tool as it will help save time and provide valuable information at a go to thus avoid wastage of public resource.","

Sometimes emergency vehicle does not get route to reach at the destination due to heavy congestion on the road. Even if its desired, driver or owner of vehicle is in such a crucial position that he/she can not give space to such emergency vehicle. Emergency vehicle may be ambulance or firefighting equipment carrying vehicle, police van or disaster management vehicle. In emergency situation, vehicle should reach in time at proper destination but unfortunately traffic situation block that vehicle. In emergency situation like severe heat attack, pregnancy , accident, fire etc. it is necessary for a vehicle to reach at the destination in short time. In medical emergency, it is necessary to provide emergency medical treatment to the patient. It is necessary to reach at nearest and best hospital in time. Most of cities and even district place are having problem of traffic and due to which ambulance and other emergency vehicles are not getting free route to reach at the destination. Other Emergency occurs anywhere at any location, at any time, and in various ways will make one at risk such as fire. Fire fighting vehicle must reach in time to save life and property. These situations require a speedy response. So it is very crucial and important to establish direct, fast and efficient technique without delay. Artificial intelligence may help us to solve this real life challenge. Patient, Fire brigade office, Hospitals, Police Traffic congestion has grown to an alarming event in major cities across India. Ambulance Driver will select route to reach hospital. System will automatically control traffic light based on population of vehicle and based on priority on that route. (Controls entire area surrounding route). Other features like Ambulance arrival indication to surrounding vehicle will give extra benefit. Emergency vehicle will be able to reach at the destination in time. If emergency vehicle is ambulance, patient will get treatment in time. Iif emergency vehicle is fire fighting equipment it will be able to control fire. If emergency vehicle is police van, it will be able to control crime. Vehicular traffic is endlessly increasing everywhere in the world and can cause terrible traffic congestion at intersections. This solution will allow emergency vehicle to get route during emergency situations. Traffic congestion and tidal flow are major facts that cause delay to ambulance.The loss of human life due to accident and delay in getting proper treatment must be avoided. In order to save human life from accidents and unnecessary delay due to traffic congestion will be avoided due to this solution and it will help to save precious human life.As cameras are deployed on most of the signals today, Computer Vision can be used for vehicle count and will be stored and updated in a steaming manner. This will thus help create effective algorithms to alter the time of the traffic signals based on this real time vehicle count, also by making sure that the traffic congestions doesnt increase exponentially and multiple emergency vehicles does not put the system in a deadlock.","

Because of harmonics, power quality disturbances, voltage deflection, neutral loading, requirement of higher capacity switchgears, life of switchgear decreases.Also, for neutral loading and unbalancing in the power system occurs and life of distribution devices like transformer will also decreases.Presently in market many devices like active filters, passive filters are available. But it leads to plant modifications and also its not cost effective solution. It also leads to shut down because of retrofication.Hence, task is to find out cost effective harmonic filters.Use of UPS, Variable frequency Drives, soft starters etc. is going to increase day by day. Hence harmonic generation cannot be eliminated.Problem solution is find out cost effective harmonic filters, which do not demand system modifications.Pharmaceuticals, chemical, agro, food, textile and other continuous plant industries.Cost effective harmonic filters if possible to install without system modification then it will benefit power system.Reduction in Neutral current, increase in power quality, increase in life of switch gears, cost saving in switch gear cost.Reduction in Neutral current, increase in power quality, increase in life of switch gears, cost saving in switch gear cost.Hence, efficient operation of all continuous plant industries.","

An experienced operator can do a good job of adjusting set points and schedule. But no matter how good they are, a humans ability is limited by the amount of data he or she can process.  Significant opportunities exist to take advantage of external data sources including realtime occupancy sensor networks, changing space schedules, weather forecasts, grid carbon intensity, and other environmental conditions that could help us better predict space setpoints and schedules 24x7.  Machine learning means each forecasting instance could be improved upon, as the system would have the ability to measure the results each time it forecasts space energy demands and readjust predicted set points and schedules accordingly.","

In govt sector sometimes we need data immediately in such scenario creating data is difficult We need a software or web portal which can store data of all students across the four districts .The data storage should be block level, district level and state level. As network is very challenging throughout the state of Sikkim. Software should be design such a way that data can be entry offline and later on put into the web when network is available. Design a desktop based application that records a variety of data like attendance or students as well as teachers, marks of students, and other statutory data as required by education department. Most important aspect of this application is sync only when network is available. It should additionally provide facility to upload file separately once in a month.","

If we place small power plant in these running streams we can generate electric power which can be used in school for various power apparatus ,machine ,Labs and others daily uses. Moreover it will be good site for electric power generation. For such we are in need of equipments to set small power plants and installation guide. Design a method to develop such models that can generate considerable amount of electricity by using waste or cheap products. Demonstrate multiple models of such power generators along with documentation that can be used by students to create such models themselves.","

5e00fa84b13f24e35733b4b2,Govt.of Sikkim,SG436,Software,Software - Web App development,Online STET (State Teacher Eligibility Test) Software or  web portal.,"Education Department Govt of Sikkim, every year conduct STET (State Teacher Eligibility Test) exam for all categories of teachers Primary Teacher, Graduate Teacher and Post Graduate Teacher before the recruitment exam. All the eligible candidates will apply for STET, so the applicants will be almost 5000. Checking all the documents, verifying them and issuing admit cards to individual candidate manually is a difficult job, which we are carrying for many years. During this span of time we made human error and had to repeat the processes. What we want : To make the STET exam error free and quick solution, we are in need of online software or window where candidates can login, register, fill the form and submit. Software should keep bio data of the candidate, print admits cards and later we can display online result of STET as well. During all the process automatic SMS and Email facilities should be included. Mobile app will be more convenient along with software. Challenges Network connectivity is not uniform all throughout the state of Sikkim so software should be develop in such a way that it can run with less network ,that is it can open only that window which candidate wants.Design a application that integrates with some reliable system like DigiLocker for verification of documents, or accept documents signed by DigiLocker eSign for document verification. Reduce manual intervention wherever possible, manual verification should be done only when final offer letter is to be issued.","
