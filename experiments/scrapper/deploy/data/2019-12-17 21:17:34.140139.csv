MIXORG,CB31,Software,Security & Surveillance,"Create an affordable solution through image processing of number plates of vehicles for the detection, identification and monitoring of vehicles  in different senarios such as residential societies, tolls, business complex, parking spaces etc.","
 Description: Many residential society administrations, tolls, business complexes and parking spaces in India lack an automated system for car parking and vehicle monitoring. Most of the commercial and residential places face an impending problem of illegal car/vehicle parking inside their premises. This issue is not bounded to just parking, but also adds to the security concerns inside those  establishments. Though there are solutions that exist in the market, the affordability comes into question. In this regard, we would like to have an affordable solution that caters to the Indian markets

Expectation:  For the team choosing this topic, we expect to have a working model / infrastructure of the solution wherein, when a vehicle passes through a  checkpost and the solution identifies as many features as it can regarding the situation of the vehicle. All Teams will be provided with an amount of video footage. The teams must build a fictitous database based on the vehicles appering in footage and demonstrate the problems that they are able to solve/automate in existing infrastucture. (For example, if a team is trying to solve problems of a residential complex, they might create a database of some of the vehicles appearing in the footage and list them as residents and others not registered in the database to be considered as visitors).

Applicants will be provided video data through the following website link.

http://mixorg.com/competitions/SIH-2020/registration
Each team is supposed to download the data and annotate it according to the features they are going to build.
Teams must come up with new features for monetization of their business model and must build machine learning models (for preliminary shortlisting and finals) and required mobile/web applications(for finals only) reflecting the same features .
Teams are requested to share the annotations done by them on the video data and the pattern of annotation.
Teams are requested to build the machine learning model and share a working code on github(privately with @chetanbansiwal or publically)

Teams will be judged on the following grounds in the same order as written for the next round :
1. Accuracy of the model in performing the expected task.
2. Speed of the model in performing the expected task.
3. The precision followed during annotation of data.
4. The relevance of annotations considering the problem the team is expecting to solve with it.

Since 6 years of its founding, it has impacted careers of 10,000+ working professionals
Great Learning’s online programs are flipped classroom instructor led programs. In flip classroom format, learners are expected to go through video lectures on a weekly basis and then participate in live online instructor led sessions in a micro group containing up to 10 learners. The agenda of instruction led session is to do a quick debrief of video lectures for the week and discuss practical applications of the concepts covered in the video lecture of the week
The problem statement is to create a mechanism to monitor and measure the attention span of the learners in the instructor led online sessions.
Following are a few ideas on the measures that can be used to quantify the level of attention span:
•         out of the designated session-time, what proportion of session was one-way dialogue vs two-way dialogue
•         number of distinct learners who participated in the session
•         presence of background noise, chatters in the session, etc..
Expected Outcomes
•         Real time dashboard that quantifies the participation for each participant
•         Real time triggers in case of sub-optimal participation
•         Suggestions (along with implementation) of other ideas to quantify level / quality of interactions

Great Learning will be sharing sample recording of the online mentored sessions

Bajaj Fin Serv,CH46,Software,Healthcare & Biomedical Devices,Gamification for Health data collection,"
 Insurance has typically been a push product where the customer is usually sold an insurance by the agents. This makes the product marketing/ sales cost too high due to low conversion rates on insurance sales. It can be said that two factors contribute to this:
1.	Insurance being viewed as an expense rather than a protection 
2.	The long and non-engaging information capture process which is required to issue the insurance. 
 
At Bajaj, we are looking to solve this problem by providing a mobile app as an engagement tool, which also helps you manage your health better. This app will also act as a source for insurance sales basis the data provided by the consumer. Gamification has emerged as a tool in the financial industry to convert the existing processes (non- engaging) into exciting activities. Some examples of the same can be capturing relevant information through quizzes (on say, world heart day) or health score generators (answer these questions to get your health score/ heart age).

 Insurance companies regularly gets health check reports submitted by potential buyers of insurance. 
We need a way to digitize different kinds of printed lab reports / health check reports to discrete values of each parameter captured. Conversion to a standardized set of digitized value will help in automating lot of backend approval process. 
Ability to read and classify comments/observations for common parameters will be a big plus
When a customer is uploading his health check report regularly, then also a trend chart can be plotted for key parameters. 
Few sample reports will be provided to the participating teams. Test will be based on that as well as unknown set of health check reports post completion.

GE Healthcare,UP49,Software,Healthcare & Biomedical Devices,Early Prediction of Sepsis from Clinical Data,"
 The goal of this Challenge is the early detection of sepsis using physiological data. For the purpose of the Challenge, defined sepsis according to the Sepsis-3 guidelines, i.e., a two-point change in the patient's Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score and clinical suspicion of infection (as defined by the ordering of blood cultures or IV antibiotics) (Singer et al., 2016).
The early prediction of sepsis is potentially life-saving, and challenging participants to predict sepsis 6 hours before the clinical prediction of sepsis. Conversely, the late prediction of sepsis is potentially life-threatening, and predicting sepsis in non-sepsis patients (or predicting sepsis very early in sepsis patients) consumes limited hospital resources.
Develop a digital solution that uses artificial intelligence to detect patient deterioration before it’s too late and trigger notifications to clinicians and care teams. Train healthcare providers and front-line staff to quickly recognize symptoms to identify sepsis and treat patients at the earliest. Also, educate preventing infections in health care settings and in the community so that infections that can lead to sepsis can be stopped before they happen. Provide guidelines to follow infection control requirements (e.g., Hand hygiene) and ensure one to receive recommended vaccines (e.g., Flu and pneumococcal, etc.).
Abstract
Sepsis is a life-threatening condition that occurs when the body's response to infection causes tissue damage, organ failure, or death (Singer et al., 2016). In the U.S., nearly 1.7 million people develop sepsis and 270,000 people die from sepsis each year; over one third of people who die in U.S. hospitals have sepsis (CDC). Internationally, an estimated 30 million people develop sepsis and 6 million people die from sepsis each year; an estimated 4.2 million newborns and children are affected (WHO). Sepsis costs U.S. hospitals more than any other health condition at $24 billion (13% of U.S. healthcare expenses) a year, and a majority of these costs are for sepsis patients that were not diagnosed at admission (Paoli et al., 2018). Sepsis costs are even greater globally with the developing world at most risk. Altogether, sepsis is a major public health issue responsible for significant morbidity, mortality, and healthcare expenses.
Early detection and antibiotic treatment of sepsis are critical for improving sepsis outcomes, where each hour of delayed treatment has been associated with roughly an 4-8% increase in mortality (Kumar et al., 2006; Seymour et al., 2017). To help address this problem, clinicians have proposed new definitions for sepsis (Singer et al., 2016), but the fundamental need to detect and treat sepsis early still remains, and basic questions about the limits of early detection remain unanswered. data set https://physionet.org/content/challenge-2019/1.0.0/
