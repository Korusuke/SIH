 Description: Many residential society administrations, tolls, business complexes and parking spaces in India lack an automated system for car parking and vehicle monitoring. Most of the commercial and residential places face an impending problem of illegal car/vehicle parking inside their premises. This issue is not bounded to just parking, but also adds to the security concerns inside those  establishments. Though there are solutions that exist in the market, the affordability comes into question. In this regard, we would like to have an affordable solution that caters to the Indian markets

Expectation:  For the team choosing this topic, we expect to have a working model / infrastructure of the solution wherein, when a vehicle passes through a  checkpost and the solution identifies as many features as it can regarding the situation of the vehicle. All Teams will be provided with an amount of video footage. The teams must build a fictitous database based on the vehicles appering in footage and demonstrate the problems that they are able to solve/automate in existing infrastucture. (For example, if a team is trying to solve problems of a residential complex, they might create a database of some of the vehicles appearing in the footage and list them as residents and others not registered in the database to be considered as visitors).

Applicants will be provided video data through the following website link.

http://mixorg.com/competitions/SIH-2020/registration
Each team is supposed to download the data and annotate it according to the features they are going to build.

The agenda of instruction led session is to do a quick debrief of video lectures for the week and discuss practical applications of the concepts covered in the video lecture of the week
The problem statement is to create a mechanism to monitor and measure the attention span of the learners in the instructor led online sessions.
Following are a few ideas on the measures that can be used to quantify the level of attention span:
•         out of the designated session-time, what proportion of session was one-way dialogue vs two-way dialogue
•         number of distinct learners who participated in the session
•         presence of background noise, chatters in the session, etc..
Expected Outcomes
•         Real time dashboard that quantifies the participation for each participant
•         Real time triggers in case of sub-optimal participation
•         Suggestions (along with implementation) of other ideas to quantify level / quality of interactions

Great Learning will be sharing sample recording of the online mentored sessions

Bajaj Fin Serv,CH46,Software,Healthcare & Biomedical Devices,Gamification for Health data collection,"
 Insurance has typically been a push product where the customer is usually sold an insurance by the agents. This makes the product marketing/ sales cost too high due to low conversion rates on insurance sales. It can be said that two factors contribute to this:
1.	Insurance being viewed as an expense rather than a protection 
2.	The long and non-engaging information capture process which is required to issue the insurance. 
 
At Bajaj, we are looking to solve this problem by providing a mobile app as an engagement tool, which also helps you manage your health better. This app will also act as a source for insurance sales basis the data provided by the consumer. Gamification has emerged as a tool in the financial industry to convert the existing processes (non- engaging) into exciting activities. Some examples of the same can be capturing relevant information through quizzes (on say, world heart day) or health score generators (answer these questions to get your health score/ heart age).

GE Healthcare,UP49,Software,Healthcare & Biomedical Devices,Early Prediction of Sepsis from Clinical Data,"
 The goal of this Challenge is the early detection of sepsis using physiological data. For the purpose of the Challenge, defined sepsis according to the Sepsis-3 guidelines, i.e., a two-point change in the patient's Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score and clinical suspicion of infection (as defined by the ordering of blood cultures or IV antibiotics) (Singer et al., 2016).
The early prediction of sepsis is potentially life-saving, and challenging participants to predict sepsis 6 hours before the clinical prediction of sepsis. Conversely, the late prediction of sepsis is potentially life-threatening, and predicting sepsis in non-sepsis patients (or predicting sepsis very early in sepsis patients) consumes limited hospital resources.
Develop a digital solution that uses artificial intelligence to detect patient deterioration before it’s too late and trigger notifications to clinicians and care teams. Train healthcare providers and front-line staff to quickly recognize symptoms to identify sepsis and treat patients at the earliest. Also, educate preventing infections in health care settings and in the community so that infections that can lead to sepsis can be stopped before they happen. Provide guidelines to follow infection control requirements (e.g., Hand hygiene) and ensure one to receive recommended vaccines (e.g., Flu and pneumococcal, etc.).
Abstract
Sepsis is a life-threatening condition that occurs when the body's response to infection causes tissue damage, organ failure, or death (Singer et al., 2016). In the U.S., nearly 1.7 million people develop sepsis and 270,000 people die from sepsis each year; over one third of people who die in U.S. hospitals have sepsis (CDC). Internationally, an estimated 30 million people develop sepsis and 6 million people die from sepsis each year; an estimated 4.2 million newborns and children are affected (WHO). Sepsis costs U.S. hospitals more than any other health condition at $24 billion (13% of U.S. healthcare expenses) a year, and a majority of these costs are for sepsis patients that were not diagnosed at admission (Paoli et al., 2018). Sepsis costs are even greater globally with the developing world at most risk. Altogether, sepsis is a major public health issue responsible for significant morbidity, mortality, and healthcare expenses.
Early detection and antibiotic treatment of sepsis are critical for improving sepsis outcomes, where each hour of delayed treatment has been associated with roughly an 4-8% increase in mortality (Kumar et al., 2006; Seymour et al., 2017). To help address this problem, clinicians have proposed new definitions for sepsis (Singer et al., 2016), but the fundamental need to detect and treat sepsis early still remains, and basic questions about the limits of early detection remain unanswered. data set https://physionet.org/content/challenge-2019/1.0.0/

GE Healthcare,UP125,Hardware,Healthcare & Biomedical Devices,Warm patient mattress,"
 Humans normally maintain a body temperature at 37°C, and maintenance of this relatively high temperature is critical to human survival.  Our bodies are designed to tightly control our internal temperature, no matter what the external temperature is.

Operating temperature in a CT/MRI/PET exam room  is normally between 18deg C to 26 Deg C and kept on an average ~22Deg C. Since room temperature is lower than your body temperature, contact surface of medical device (mattress, pad, support surfaces etc..) quickly absorb the heat from patient’s skin, making patient feel cold. This discomfort to patient during medical imaging /Interventional procedures increases the negative patient outcome due to patient shivering & unintended patient motion. Due to this cold temperature, patients may activate “brown” fat at contact surface which contains adrenergic receptors and generates heat by metabolizing glucose. This can show up on scans and potentially hide true “lesions” in PET imaging.

Currently hospitals uses blankets to cover or to enfold a great portion of the Patient's body during scan to trap radiant bodily heat and keeping the body warm. Hospitals uses a lot of blankets as each patient requires a new / washed blanket.. busy centers will go through on avg. 10 blankets in a day. 
Key Constraints: 
User adjustable temperature 
Automated temperature control to set temperature “ Range 20°C -40°C”. Quick response to set temperature within 3 min.
Mattress/Pad material:- Radiolucency , MR Compatibility, Biocompatible and Easy to clean.
Comfortable foam pad
Mattress/pad size: 2mtr length x 0.42 mtr width
On/Off switch and Indicator
Accurate measurement of temperature of warm mattress/bed (Tolerance +/-1 Deg)
Current temperature display of the heating pad/mattress all the time.
Fail safe heating mechanism-redundant temperature cut off mechanism
Goal : Develop a ~2 meter long warm patient mattress/pad to provide mild warmness to patients during Imaging systems (PET/CT/MRI/Interventional Imaging Systems)

 Is Traffic Jams a big problem in India? Can we think an out of the box solution to solve this and make commuting an easy accessible to everyone.

Here is an opportunity for you to think Innovative and Design a “Personal Air Vehicle (PAV)”

Abstract:
A Personal Air Vehicle (PAV), also Personal Aerial Vehicle, is an emergent aviation market that would provide on-demand aviation services. This term was first used by NASA in 2003 when it established the Personal Air Vehicle Sector Project, as part of the Aeronautics Vehicle Systems Program. 
In the current situation where most of the population moving towards Metro cities, traffic management has become most critical issue. Stepping ahead from the current transport system, it is important to adopt emerging technologies for newer product innovation. Flying Vehicle or AirCAR, or Quadcopter could be ideal solution for future generation.
What we are seeking is an “everyone” personal flying Vehicle, capable of being flown by ANYONE, ANYWHERE. It should be a vehicle for ALL, young and old, city-dweller.
Recent advances in propulsion, energy, light-weight materials, and control and stability systems have combined to produce a moment of achievable innovation. The vehicle should function safely in both crowded cities and rural areas; it should be lightweight and manoeuvrable enough so that anyone can move it around.
 
Digital Design Output:
Design a PAV using Autodesk Fusion 360 Software (Free for education & Students) system to enable movement of such vehicles safely in the air traffic by allocating paths, height. The system should additionally provide methods to raise and manage SOS calls.

The Design should pass through all the below mentioned phases
-	Ideation/Conceptualization- Freeform digital modelling
-	Modelling/Designing- 3D solid Digital model on Fusion 360
-	Simulation and Analysis- should be capable to carry 2 person which is 120 Kg min 
-	Rendering and Animation- Apply colour, lights, background to share aesthetic image of your model.

Bharat Forge Ltd,SP292,Hardware,Robotics & Drones,Design and Development of working prototype of Helicopter Turbo-propellers,"
 Before fully functional helicopters, in 1960's people are using helicopter turbo-propellers for vertical takeoff and landing of planes. Helicopter Turbo-props are the propellers having propulsion system mounted at tip of the blades. The major idea about this is to reduce the travel cost per passenger as turbo props are more efficient, provide high endurance than that of the normal helicopter blades and provides two times the speed to the plane. On the other hand unbearable noise is one of the issue in helicopter turbo-props. In this problem statement, students are supposed to make the working prototype of helicopter turbo-props. These propellers should be designed in such a way that, it should lift and land a foam model of an aircraft weighing 700 grams. Successful flight test of the same is mandatory for the completion of the project.

NALCO,PN313,Hardware,Smart Vehicles,TRACKING and Control of Hot METAL TRANSPORTATION TRUCKS,"
 NALCO Smelter Plant has 04 Pot lines with 08 Pot Rooms and each Pot Room having 120 Pots. There are 2 Cast Houses and 1 Rolling Plant as well. Hot metal is tapped through Tapping Ladles from 960 pots and then transferred into transport ladles on the metal transporting trucks (MTT) for delivery to the desired Cast House Location as per the requisition made by the individual Cast Houses and Rolling Plant. 

 N.B:        	
•	Maximum 16 nos. of trucks can be deployed in the Pot Rooms.
•	The liquid metal is tapped at around 960°C.
•	The Cast House desired temperature range for metal casting 720°C-760°C.
•	If the metal arrives at little above the casting temperature value then it is ready for casting and no fuel is required to be burnt in the metal holding casting furnaces.

 
Operation:

A.	Cast House–A (Operation) prepares Metal Planning Schedule for 04 shifts on daily basis and forwards Hard/Soft Copy to Pot Line (Operation).

B.	After receipt of the metal planning schedule the Pot Line (Operation) shift-in-charge prepares tapping schedule for his shift.
  
C.	From the tapping schedule ladle schedule is derived along with the metal dispatch against requirement by Cast House (Operation).

D.	Accordingly MTT deployment by the Pot Line (Operation) transport section is arranged for each Pot Line Room Location to the respective Cast House in a Merry-go-Round fashion during the shift hours. 

E.	Normally Cast House-B and Rolling Plant forward their shift wise ladle requirement, in terms of no. of ladles required by them in a shift, initially to the Transport Section of Pot Line (Operation).

F.	Balance left out hot metal available is dispatched to Cast House-A along with any adjustment required for handling of no. of ladles available with Pot Line (Operation) arising out of additional requirement raised or surplus metal available from Cast House-B and Rolling Plant Shops due to operational issues.

G.	Shift wise hot metal reconciliation between Pot Line (Operation) and Cast House is carried out on daily basis to tally the records with the quantity of the metal dispatched and received by the Cast House during the day against the metal planning made.

 
Problems:
The entire operation is manual as of now. There is no single window available for operation and coordination job. The transit time required between demand and supply involves various factors such as trip length, information on availability of vehicle, tracking of vehicle location. As a result, trucks may arrive later than the demanded time resulting in drop of loaded ladle metal temperature. All this leads to wastage of heat energy, longer wait time and longer metal truck haulage at times.

Moreover, Data portability, processing and reporting, all are manual. Hence a need for IOT based vehicle mounted pilot project which will save energy, time, etc. and help us greatly in avoiding chaos situations.

Improvements Desired:
To devise an IOT based vehicle mounted pilot project which shall ensure real time data connectivity on: 

Vehicle location tracking through LPS. (UWB  / RTLS / Indoor-Locating / LPS)
Information on availability of vehicle.
Live metal temperature data from ladle.
Vehicle call request with location.
Driver acknowledgement for call request.
Vehicle identification through code broadcast.

The proposed project will enable to achieve the following:

Reduced Metal Transporting Trucks turnaround time leading to lower haulage losses.
Reduced occurrences of ladle hot metal temperature drop due to smaller and faster haulage time.
More efficient control of vehicle logistics reducing chaos due to vehicle unavailability/in traceability.
Reduction of possibility of metal outage at either of Cast Houses, Rolling Plant.
Reduction in consumption of fuel oil required for reheating of liquid metal.

We could potentially use Drones for last mile delivery of items. While current prevalent addressing mechanism such as lat/long and post code are good enough for humans, these won’t work for drone delivery as all houses in a multi-storey building will have same lat/long or post-code. Design a solution which can help drones to identify each address / flat as a separate unit and deliver the item accordingly.

MathWorks,AG343,Software,Energy / Renewable Energy,"Renewable Energy forecasting, for an integrated smart grid","
 BACKGROUND:
Advances in technology have enabled large-scale harnessing of sources of renewable energy (solar, wind etc.).  Smart grids which integrate both conventional energy sources and renewable sources are envisioned to be a sustainable power generation solution. However, all sources of renewable energy are affected by environmental factors (such as wind speed, intensity of solar radiation, cloud cover) which causes fluctuations in power generated from these sources. Also, the availability are subjected to daily/annual cycles (eg. Solar energy available during daytime only). While smart metering enables real-time demand forecasting; accurate models that forecast power generated by renewable energy sources are also needed.  Accurate forecasting models will ensure grid stability, smooth scheduling and energy management.  For instance, if the model forecasts renewable energy outage for a certain duration of time, the smart grid must seamlessly switch to the conventional energy source for that duration and ensure that the generated power meets the demand forecast.  Literature proposes various learning-based forecasting models for renewable energy sources based on open data sources; as well as scheduling strategies for demand-supply matching. Further, simulation software to realistically model microgrids are also available. The problem defined here is to come up with a framework which: realistically simulates a microgrid; forecasts demand and supply of (renewable) energy; seamlessly schedules supply of renewable (and conventional energy) to meet the demand; and provides actionable insights about the functioning of the smart grid system.

PROBLEM STATEMENT:
1.	Simulate the microgrid/utility system with various consumers and prosumers.
2.	For the renewable energy sources, using environment time series data from open data forums-develop energy generation forecasting models. 
3.	For the consumers/prosumers using energy consumption time series data from open data forums-develop energy demand forecasting models. 
4.	Develop scheduling algorithms for the utility/microgrid controller.
5.	Integrate the forecasting model and scheduler with the simulation setup in 1.
6.	Prototype the following use case with developed models: 
An Integrated Smart Grid utility manager would want to remotely monitor the operations of the deployed system in real-time. The manager will require a dashboard that provides a micro- and macroscopic spatio-temporal trend of: (a) consumer demand maps; (b) prosumer supply; (c) solar/wind energy generated; (d) conventional energy generated; (e) outages; (f) accuracies of forecasting models for energy demand and energy generated (conventional and renewable); (g) scheduling decision report.

OUTCOME EXPECTED:
1.	A microgrid simulation model (with scheduling strategy integrated at controller).
2.	Forecasting models to predict demand, renewable energy generated. (possibly Statistical/Machine Learning models).
3.	Scheduling strategy/algorithm to manage resources to meet demands. (optimization algorithm based on forecasting model of demand and generation).
4.	A web-application of the dashboard with appropriate visualizations and reports.

 BACKGROUND: 
Traffic control for the people, by the people”. The smart phone-based Application captures the traffic flout and directly share it with traffic control team. App will have information about Traffic rules with best user interactive appearance. App will reduce Burden on traffic control team.  

PROBLEM STATEMENT: The traffic is huge problem in metro cities in India and to monitor it throughout a day it’s the difficult task. The Traffic control and monitoring team can control this up to certain extent. However, the main responsibilities lie on individual. The simple smart phone-based application has capability to record the rule breaking and flout traffic situation which will be shared with traffic control team (Traffic Police). In current situation, the traffic control team uses a camera to capture people with flouting traffic rules and along with this they have to control the city traffic too. It is difficult for them to keep an eye on both the activities at a time. To reduce their workload, an individual can install this app and will be able to share the evidence with traffic control team.  The awareness of this app will lead an individual to follow traffic rule strictly in order to avoid mistakes done by others. The app will have traffic rule guidelines which will help an individual to learn more about traffic rules. The app will provide credit to user on capturing valid traffic flout. The App can cover large scale to small scale Traffic rule evades (e. g. No Parking, Pedestrian crossing evades). Each individual can contribute toward traffic control, awareness, and behavior of individual toward traffic rules.

 Search and Rescue (SAR) is an operation to find and rescue the people in distress. SAR operations aim at finding missing objects with minimum time in a determined area. There are fundamentally two problems in these operations. The first problem is assessing highly reliable probability distribution maps, and the second is determining the search pattern that sweeps the area from the air as fast as possible. SAR operations benefit greatly from the GIS technology. The area, determined by the search planner, that is to be searched is called Search Area. This area may be sub-divided into search sub-areas for the purpose of assigning specific responsibilities to the available search facilities. The International Aeronautical and Maritime Search and Rescue Manual (IAMSAR) Vol. II (ICAO DOC 9731) provides all necessary information and guidance. Projecs intends to achive: • Determining the size of the search area from the Last Known Position (LKP), including speed, heading and attitude, of aircraft.

Airports facilities includes Arrival baggage belts, boarding gates, Parking Stands, Trolleys etc.  The application must have a separate API to have a visual representation of the analysed data which can be integrate with any other web/desktop application. Project intents to achieve the below objectives:
• Classification of data based on nature of facility used by a passenger and available facility utilization.
• Data visualization at Airport and Pan India Level.
• A centralized Dashboard containing visual data representation of the % utilization of Airport services used by passengers.

Airports Authority of india,AK14,Software,Software - Mobile App development,An Mobile based Dwell time Management System using IOT.,"
 Whenever a passenger enters into an airport, their credentials are checked at check in Kiosks, Entry Gates, SHA, Immigration & customs and boarding gates to validate their journey. Usually a passenger is instructed to come two hrs before for a domestic travel and four hours before an international travel.
 This instruction is given to passengers as their validation process might take more time than usual due to long passenger queues at each check point. The time taken by passenger to stand in a queue at a particular touch point and gets its credentials validated is called dwell time of that touch point.
Hence, a mobile application based dwell time data collection and analysis at touch points of airports including check-in counters/Entry Gates/SHA/Immigration and customs/boarding gates using IOT. The Automated system needs to prompt necessary alert messages as per escalation matrix for dynamic allocation of manpower and facilities for a particular check point.

What we want: 
• Monitoring Effective Utilization of Airport touch points
• Central data base record for each dwell time data collection.
• An external API integration facility to connect with existing Airport Software’s.

 India has vast length of roads within cities, towns and villages. Also connected to them are the national highways (total length of national highways being about 1.3 million km). Most of the streets are illuminated from evening to morning averaging about 12 hours per day within the habitations. It is well understood that some of the streets may not have vehicles or even pedestrians passing through them throughout the night. In such scenarios there is wastage of electrical energy for illumination of streets. Smart street light management would mean that sensors can sense a movement in an area and switch on the lights before the vehicle or pedestrian passes by and switch it off during no movement thus saving electrical energy.

Department of Atomic Energy,PC85,Hardware,Smart Communication,Laser based Vibration Sensor operated through mobile,"
 Vibration detection plays an important role in the different areas of structural health monitoring and industrial engineering. If the vibration increases above the permissible limits, it might lead to the failure of these structures and machines. Thus, it is very important to continuously monitor the vibration of a critical structure or machine. Vibration can be expressed in terms of its amplitude and frequency. Laser based vibration measurement has gained importance due to its non-contact, non-destructive nature and fast speed. Laser Vibrometer is based on optical triangulation technique. In Triangulation technique for vibration measurement, visible laser beam emitted from a diode laser strikes the target and the backscattered light is collected by suitable optics to focus on a position sensitive detector (PSD). Laser source, target and focusing optics form a triangle. The position of focused spot on the detector is related to the distance of the target from the sensor thus displacement of focused spot on detector is related to the displacement of the target from its equilibrium position. The PSD converts optical signal into electrical signal. Thus a vibration displacement signal in electrical form is generated by the sensor, which corresponds to mechanical vibration of the target. For simple harmonic motion, an optical triangulation based displacement sensors generate a sinusoidal signal whose frequency corresponds to frequency of vibration.
Laser vibrometer uses low power Laser diode as light source. The instrument consists in two parts 
I.	Sensor, consisting of Laser light source (Diode Laser), optical system (Focusing lens) to collect the back-scattered light after it has interacted with the object, detection system consisting of opto-electronic device (PSD) and analog electronic circuit to process the detector output and generate ±5V output corresponding to ±5 mm displacement of the object. This analog voltage is to be digitized and then transmitted using blue tooth technology to the nearest mobile phone.
II.	An application program on mobile phone will receive the dynamic displacement data from laser sensor and computes the FFT of the signal. This calculated FFT spectrum will carry the amplitude and frequency contents of the vibration. The calculated frequency spectrum is to be displayed in graphical form on the mobile screen and important parameters like dominant frequencies and their amplitude will be extracted from the spectrum and separately displayed.
Thus the problem consists of development of compact laser sensor with wireless transmission capability, battery operated and size of the palm for vibration measurement. Then development of suitable Android based  mobile app to communicate to the sensor and display frequency spectrum and important vibration parameters on mobile screen.

to as the ‘Image Coordinate System’(ICS). Any procedure planned in medical
scans under ICS can be transfered to patient domain by utilizing this mapping.
The challenge of accurately establishing this mapping (or registration)
between PCS and ICS plays a critical role in influencing the reliability of the
surgery procedure itself. Currently accepted practice involves the use of
special markers called the ‘fiducials’ for the purpose of estimating PCS-to-ICS
mapping. Apart from estiablishing correspondances between the appearance
of fiducials in both patient and image coordinate systems, autonomas and
accurate localization of these markers in image coordinate system is an open-
challenge. Currently, surgeons manually annotate and localize these fiducials
or utilize semi-automatic tools provided by their treatment planning suite. The
goal of this challenge is therefore, to develop fully autonomas algorithm for
detection and localization of fiducials in pre-operative scans. Concretely, the
participants will be provided with MRI head-scans with fiducials affixed on the
skull surface and the task will be to estimate 3D coordinates of the center of
these fiducials with respect to the image coordinate system. Accruacy of their
algorithm will be tested on the corresponding ground-truth values and
generalization will be evaluated based on unseen test data.

 ""In case of man-made emergency situations which disrupt public life on greater scale e.g. war, tested solutions for rapid communications among large numbers of devices is required for relief efforts as well as monitoring of environment. A Mobile AdhocNETworking(MANET) protocol based on device geographical location information is conceptualized to serve as a gate way device. Problem is coding, simulation and testing of scalability. A network routing protocol is scalable in terms of number of nodes when it can accommodate additional nodes without increase of overhead for given limited area. The conceptualizedMANET protocolshall establish the source to destination path similar to zone routing protocols (ZRP). The path to destination is referred at source, in terms of the geological zones therefore allowing movement of intermediate mobile devices across path without disturbing the path. The devices get assigned new zone automatically using the GPS. The simulation scenario shall be source node is searching a path to friendly destination device, exchange data (hello) and drop the link. The devices follow random mobility pattern in 2 D frame. For searching of devices there is pre condition of knowing past history or pattern or set of fixed zones where destination node can reside. This is close to real world scenario where destinations reside at known zonessuch as home, office, commutation route, friend’s place, entertainment hub in area, railway station, airport etc. The MANET protocol, by nature of precondition, of knowing the possibility of location of devices; protects from spam connection and un authorized network broadcast. It is allowed ato modify the protocol to certain level to improve security, privacy without diluting the basic principal. The simulation is required to test the claim of scalability level in terms of N devices in simulation. A set of software codes will be required to be developed for simulation of the routing protocol.The simulation can be done using open source network simulator. It is required to test and simulate the concept of this routing protocol and its scalability. The metric of scalability will be success in search, establish and dropping the links between pairs of devices and amount of information shared when not having links. The largest possible MANET size is required to be order of 1000s. All MANET devices shall be interchangeable and there will not be any infrastructure dedicated node. All devise shall be replaceable without affecting MANET performance. Fixed location nodes can be used.
An example application can be MANET for police cars or disaster relief providers to enable connectivity in them without having to connect to any public network.""

Department of Atomic Energy,PC88,Hardware,Healthcare & Biomedical Devices,Generalized Epileptic Seizure Alert System,"
 Epilepsy is a central nervous system (neurological) disorder in which brain activity becomes abnormal, causing seizures or periods of unusual behavior, sensations, and sometimes loss of awareness.Of the 70 million persons with epilepsy (PWE) worldwide, nearly 12 million PWE are expected to reside in India; which contributes to nearly one-sixth of the global burden. Epilepsy often manifests itself in childhood and is a cause of immense concern for the parents who are often kept on their toes anticipating the next seizure event. This causes psychological and health concerns amongst the primary caregivers who often stay awake through the night in anticipation.

Seizures are of many kind with the most prevalent being generalized tonic-clonic seizure A generalized tonic-clonic seizure, sometimes called a grand mal seizure, is a disturbance in the functioning of both sides of the brain. This disturbance is caused by electrical signals spreading through the brain inappropriately. Often this will result in signals being sent to the muscles, nerves, or glands. The spread of these signals in the brain can make one lose consciousness and have severe muscle contractions.The aim of this project is to develop a battery powered, low cost,portable generalized tonic-clonic seizure alert device which can notify nearby family or caregivers when a seizure occurs through alarms, phone calls or text alerts, depending on the device. A caregiver can then help the person during and after the seizure. For example, they can help reposition the person, making sure they are on their side if they are not conscious. They can also make sure someone doesn’t fall asleep on their stomach afterwards. If breathing or other problems occur, they can call for medical help. They may also be able to give rescue medications or call for an ambulance if the seizure lasts too long or the person has repeated seizures.

The project aims at using Inertial Measurement Unit/tri axial accelerometer as the primary sensing unit coupled with advanced signal processing and machine learning techniques to detect abnormal motions akin to seizures in the patients body.The proposed instrument shall also consist of heartbeat monitoring system for additional analytics related to sleep quality monitoring. The project has significant hardware and software challenges which includes accurate measurement and classification of jerking motions,continuous low power heart rate monitoring, signal processing and machine learning algorithms at a very low power budget. The proposed device will reduce burden on the primary caregivers or family members who often spend sleepless nights anticipating the seizure event.

Department of Atomic Energy,PC89,Hardware,Security & Surveillance,Digital Imaging of Objects behind Steel walls,"
 Steel is widely used material for fabrication of machinery and equipments in almost all the industries. Maintenance of these equipments may become very expensive and time consuming if it requires de-assembling, inspection and then re-assembling. So, an innovative technology can be developed which will help in machinery inspection in assembled condition by digitally imaging all the objects inside it like X-Rays for human body. This will help in identifying the cause of the malfunction of the machinery and necessary action can be taken.
Solution methodology
Light waves can pass through glass walls and reflect from the objects behind it. This makes us able to see through a glass wall. Similarly, some other EM waves can pass through concrete walls. There are already many technological developments going on worldwide to use this fact to locate objects behind the concrete walls. Even, moving human body can be detected behind concrete wall upto certain distance using available technology.
As EM waves cannot pass through steel walls, use of sound waves/ultrasound can be explored. Instrumentation developed (both software and hardware) should be able to detect either the sound waves generated behind steel wall or send a known sound pulse and get its echo reflected from the objects behind the wall. Developed technology can be envisaged as the multiple microphones mounted on many locations on the machinery to detect and locate the position of the object generating sound.
Final outcome
A set of compatible hardware and software is to be developed which will be able to detect and locate either the source of sound or create a digital imaging of all the objects behind the steel wall. There should be provision of adjusting the frequency transmitted and received by sensors to consider varying thickness of the wall and material of objects behind it.
Challenges
Since wave propagation inside the machinery involves very little distance, time difference obtained from various objects behind the steel wall is supposed to be very less. It will be very difficult to detect and differentiate the sound signal obtained from the objects. Advances signal processing technique will be required to be developed to accomplish this task.

The solution must be of low cost and longer duration one.Design a software system to predict life of a bridge depending various conditions of environment, take inputs as design of bridge, latitute and longitude of bridge, access some API to get information about predicted environmental condidions and use that data to predict life of the bridge. This system should be used to modify the design to increase the life of the bridge.

 Though there exists a technology for face recognition based authentication, dynamic human recognition based authentication is highly challenging. For a given entrance gate a hardware-software solution is needed to identify every unique person who enters or exit the gate, with log of all previous entry/exit time, photo/videos recorded. That means there will not be a previous history of an individual on the first entry. The system should immediately alert the security if it is a new person and the security will decide to allow/restrict that person entering inside the premises. Whereas , the system should learn from its previous history of videos/images dynamically to allow a known person. For a given size of the gate the number of cameras with optimal resolution required is also to be worked out as part of solution. The solution should be scalable and preferably based open source.

 Goa is a major tourist destination which pulls thousands of tourists every year. Goa is known for its beautiful beaches and hospitality. There are a number of monuments and landmarks depicting the cultural, history and development of Goa.
Due to high inflow of domestic as well as international tourists, the manpower required to guide the tourist on these landmark is not sufficient and sometimes lack in the information that need to be given and highlighted to the tourist. 
Hence we propose the problem of developing a mobile application which renders information about the monument or landmark just by taking their live pictures as inputs. In other word, the application should allow the user to click a photograph and based on the picture it should display information about the monument/landmark.
The application should also notify the user about such monuments/landmarks in the vicinity.
The app should also allow the user to give their inputs about the object and also add to knowledge creation about the monuments/landmark.
The app should also be able to keep statics about the number of users referring to the monument/landmark along with details of the users.

 Scarcity of clean drinking water is a serious problem globally. The natural sources of pure drinking water are declining and are getting polluted. Use of pesticides, fertilizers, dumping of e-waste such as batteries, plastic, etc has lead to such high levels of contamination of water that consumption of it has resulted in outbreak of diseases such as cancer. These contaminants could be visible or non-visible to eyes. Hence the problem statement is to develop a device that would help us measure the purity of water by checking the amount of pollutants, harmful chemicals, plastic molecules, microorganism.

Government of Andhra Pradesh,KB141,Software,Software - Web App development,"Design State Research Portal, a single point securely hosted solution to seamlessly integrate search and manage all the research activities","
 The act of research sets the course for the development of any product or service. Without comprehensive research, all stages that follow in research activities could be greatly affected. Finding the required information for research can be difficult as the resources and information on internet and otherwise are often located in dispersed places, and accessing the right content can be time consuming. 

In this context, a single State research portal is needed to be designed in a manner that it can serve as a one-stop research portal for all the State Universities and colleges comprising the essential areas/parameters. Few of the areas to be incorporated are as given below:
a.	Navigating to information: It should be built on user experience best practices. As researchers are used to accessing websites (whether in their personal or professional lives) that respond to their screen size and are optimized for mobile, but also contain ideal user experience elements to make it easy to navigate (think single search bar front and center, clear organization of content etc.). 
b.	Uploading research, discovery of and access to information:  It should be a user-friendly research portal wherein the researchers can search and discover the right information and content for their work. They also be able to upload their research work university/college/miscellaneous wise which may further be categorized department/areas of study wise. 

A discovery service is the next tool to consider integrating into research portal. Consider how metadata is used, the methodology around searching and retrieving search results, how the tool anticipates users’ needs, and what can be integrated into the discovery tool. 

c.	Authentication: As research and collection of information resources become increasingly digital, authentication will be a key component to ensure the security of users and their content. For example, your collection may offer users access to various publisher or research platforms/portals that all have varying requirements for authentication. Entry into these resources is expected to be seamless and intuitive by researchers.

"Central Water Commission, Ministry of Jal Shakti",SK153,Software,Miscellaneous,Embankment Mapping and Crowdsourced Health Card for Preventive Structural Measures,"
 The inspection and monitoring of health of embankment for preventive maintenance is a massive and intensive exercise which has huge financial ramifications. The manpower requirements for effectively carrying out such an important exercise is very high keeping in view large number of embankment protection works across river networks which are not easily accessible at times. Therefore, preventive maintenance of embankments needs a technological solutioninvolving participation of localsto safeguard the public property and life.

One such solution may be through the use of embankment mapping and crowdsourced health card. Embankment mapping involves the development of GIS application to analyse the existing river embankment network. The crowd sourced data with images, geo-location and time stamp can be used for the generation of health card of embankment and identifying the critical sections thereof for their preventive maintenance.

"Central Water Commission, Ministry of Jal Shakti",SK155,Software,Miscellaneous,Water Accounting in Irrigation Commands through Crowd Sourced Crop Mapping,"
 Lack of dynamic crop maps and opacity in water utilisation data prevents proper water accounting at the level of irrigation commands. Information regarding area under various crops is generally available at an aggregate level e.g. district wise cultivated area under individual crops. Non-availability ofactual crop maps preventsspatial visualisation of water utilisation and therefore proper water accounting. National Remote Sensing Centre (NRSC), Hyderabad generates yearly Land Use Land Cover (LULC) maps at a finer resolution of 56m containing land use classes of crop season and number of crops (single/multiple crop). Crowdsourced information from farmers, agricultural extension service providers, local administration and local population may be used for generation of crop type maps for a particular irrigation season which in turn may be used for preparation of water accounts at various spatial scales rangingfrom command of a major to minor irrigation project. Water Accounting at various spatial and temporal scales in commands of irrigation projects will help in informed decision making during the ensuing crop season and leads to optimal utilisation of irrigation water.

Every individual has an inherent ability /talent. if only he/she gets a job suiting the skill set the goal of AICTE will be achieved. Higher productivity will be there and youth power has a major role to play in a Nation's growth . Economy will improve. 
The proposed software should identify the skill set and assess the capacity of a student. It should recommend the suitable candidates against a requirement from the industry.

 India is Diabetic Capital of the World. India has the highest number of diabetics of any one country in the entire world. Over 30 million have now been diagnosed with diabetes in India. In rural areas, the prevalence is approximately 3 per cent of the total population, the urban areas it is expected to be 9 per cent. 
Persons suffering with diabetes have to constantly monitor their blood sugar levels and take insulin accordingly. Till now the glucometers are invasive and the process is painful. We have seen devices like Pulse Oxy-meters which are convenient to use and give accurate readings for oxygen levels (SPO2) in blood. Having a Glucometer just like Pulse-oxymeters, which is non-invasive & accurate is a big requirement and has a huge market. 
The Challenge posted is for having a Glucometer just like Pulse-oxymeters.

Government of Andhra Pradesh,KB189,Software,Sustainable Environment,APPCB looks forward to bringing in all polluting industries in the state to enhance the existing system more transparent and effective monitoring of emissions and effluents.  APPCB envisages implementing Internet of Things (loT) technology for obtaining of authentic and reliable data directly from the analyzers installed at the industry rather than the data from the intermediary system.,"
 Andhra Pradesh Pollution Control Board (APPCB) is a statutory organization entrusted to implement Environmental Laws and control pollution in the state of Andhra Pradesh through regulations.

APPCB is presently using cloud-based software to connect all the analyzers installed at the industries to obtain real time data. The data received is analyzed to monitor the exceedances against the prescribed standards for each industry. APPCB looks forward to bringing in all polluting industries in the state to enhance the existing system more transparent and effective monitoring of emissions and effluents.

As an extensively modernizing state, Andhra Pradesh is developing its industrial sector vigorously. Industries being significant source of both emission and effluents, are required to be monitored stringent monitoring. 

APPCB uses monitoring tools namely Continuous Emission Monitoring System (CEMS) and Continuous Effluent Quality Monitoring System (CEQMS) to check release of polluting emission and effluent to the environment. CEMS and CEQMS comprises analytical components and are continuous real time tools, providing monitoring data every minute.

Although there is a system of real time monitoring of polluting emissions and effluents from industries, APPCB is trying to develop a more efficient system that can provide authentic Continuous Emission Monitoring System (CEMS) and Continuous Effluent Quality Monitoring System (CEQMS). CEMS and CEQMS are calibrated in such a way that it collates data from different types of industries falling under different make and model as well as pollution category. Since each industrial sector under each pollution category may have set emission and effluent standards as prescribed by Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) or standardized by APPCB as per the local environmental conditions, ensuring reliability and consistency of the data received through CEMS and CEQMS are important.

Other areas of improvement for implementation of CEMS/CEQMS are as follows: Ensuring quality assurance of equipment and suitable technology, most reliable method of installation of analyzers, effectual reliable operation, ensuring credible data, viable data transfer calibration and maintenance of the equipment etc.

Additionally, enhancement of the existing online monitoring system is also required for development of an unswerving emission and effluent database for the state of Andhra Pradesh. Above mentioned are the need of the hour for Andhra Pradesh state as 13 town/cities in the state are already listed in the list of Non-Attainment cities w.r.t air pollution and five river stretches are categorized as polluted. It is crucial for APPCB as the key regulatory agency for pollution in the state.

Current System using in detailed:
Andhra Pradesh Pollution Control Board uses cloud-based software to connect all the analyzers installed at the industries to obtain real time data. The data received is analyzed to monitor the exceedances against the prescribed standards for each industry. APPCB looks forward to bringing in all polluting industry categories existing in the state to be adequately monitored to check pollution in the long run.

Significant indicators taken into consideration under CEMS are the emission and effluent quality standard limits as prescribed by the Board based on the industry type, category, local conditions and the characteristics of the emission and effluents by the industry.

APPCB envisages implementing Internet of Things (loT) technology for obtaining of authentic and reliable data directly from the analyzers installed at the industry rather than the data from the intermediary system.

 Brief concept behind the problem statement - Niruha Basti (Medicated Enema) is a uniform mixture of Honey, Salt, Sneha (Oil/Ghee), Kalka (Herbal paste) and Kwatha (Herbal Decoction).
The ingredients of basti dravya are to be mixed in specific order to obtain the perfect mixture. 
Honey and rock salt were mixed together in the beginning followed by addition of Sesame oil. This mixture was then thoroughly mixed. The finely wet grinded paste of Herbal drugs was then mixed in it thoroughly. The decoction of herbal drugs is then added to it and the mixture was subjected to thorough churning in a domestic mixer to produce a homogeneous mixture. The mixture thus produced acquires a physical state of emulsion.
Solution – 
If there can be an AUTOMATIC BASTI BLENDER for crushing and blending basti or enema ingredients with base/bowl  made of wood/metal/ceramic/granite with heavy pestle connected to machine that rotates automatically around the base at a specific speed 
There should be separate sections of main 5 ingredients i.e, honey, salt, oil, paste of drug and decoction of drug.
The automatic blender should be pre- programmed for each ingredient to be instilled into the bowl/mortar in a specific measurable amount ( as per the percentage of each ingredient required in the final product) automatically at a specific interval with the help of a set self- timer attched into it.
This will not only help making Basti/ Enema conveniently but also will  prevent individual differences in final Basti by making a standard final manufactured Basti.

Ministry of Rural Development,MK199,Software,Agriculture and Rural Development,Automatic Assessment of Pavement condition based on road photographs,"
 Works constructed under the PMGSY scheme are to be maintained by the contractor as per the PMGSY guidelines.
Pavement Condition Index is required to be performed to identify the road condition and further to take the
maintenance or upgradation of the work.
Through EMARG and PMGSY-III, NRIDA has collected a vast collection of pictures of roads. These pictures are
collected while doing inspection of roads or collection of PCI through visual inspections. An AI assisted module
would be able to automatically assess the picture and identify common issues such as shoulder clearance,
potholes, road furniture etc.
Requirement is of a solution where there should be a provision to capture the chainage wise pavement condition
index. Use of open source software and existing neural network is encouraged.
Train a machine learning model, computer vision etc. which is able to identify common issues with pavement based
on photograph(s) per road alone.

 Images are captured as part of validation/proof under various programs for separate reasons.

* Images of houses being constructed under PMAY-G, works/assets created under MGNREGA, PDFs (Placement documents, Offer letter,
Salary Slips etc.) being uploaded under DDUGKY validating proof of employment, Pictures of Works like Road Construction/Upgradation,
Drain Construction/Upgradation, Canal Irrigation Construction etc. under Rurban.PMGSY Program are captured.
Pics are majorly being uploaded through Mobile App having timestamp & geo tagged data. Physical verification/review of images is done for
each pic. Collectively, over 8 crore images have been collected in multiple DBs.

It is required that an automated solution (including Deep learning, image processing algorithms, AI algorithms etc.) be developed which is
able to automatically identify the type of image (preferred 3D capture), classify and segment, validate and categorize nature of image type,
identify the object, define boundaries etc. highlight duplicates (Plagiarism) , invalid pics etc. A software may be developed which at time of
photo capture is able to capture, analyse and classify pixels, read text (OCR, Google lens etc.) and help in defining type. Would be helpful if it
is able to calculate length, breadth, width (depth) etc. also.

A holistic solution (Automation) is required which can help address these gaps, simplify the process and provide better results. The solution
may reference 3D image (GIF), image processing technologies, image analysis, optimization, segmentation, and restoration, algorithm,
computer vision and image processing (CVIP) technologies etc. Would help if solution devised is light weight (size of photo capture) and using
open source tools.

limited to a Mobile App based solution) which is feasible, less complex in implementation, address all challenges and
eliminates the gaps in current system promoting transparency and less corruption/fraudulent entries. The system

 We are looking for solution of automatic checking of parcels in parcel offices (both booked by Railway and leaseholders). We are expecting the solution to be (1) Automatic (without human intervention), (2) quick and (3) cost effective. Expectations from solution are (1) It shold automatically detect and check parcels in parcel office (booked by both Railway and leaseholders). Parcels' count and details should be updated to centralised server. (2) Software component should show details of parcels (eg. PRR/PWB no., Source, Destination, To, From, Content, etc.) in parcel office to officials and operators. (3) If parcel is dispatched from parcel office, it should be removed from In Office Parcels and if parcel is received at Parcel office, it should be added to In Office Parcels.

2.	With over 500 process houses in and around Surat, printing has been a natural extension to value addition for all the process houses. Most of them have at least 4 printing machines, with capacity to print about 3000 to 30000 meters per machine per day depending upon the design.
3.	There exists a business opportunity for having small sized digital partners synchronized with the existing equipment to get value added output at one go, while most of the printers are imported, industry also plans to develop a prototype of Indian made printing machine in the long run.
4.	Surat leads in multi-color design printing on fabrics. It can become a hub for digital and Laster fabric printing for the world, should the units be equipped with printing equipment of varied sizes.
5.	The equipment for printing machines is an equally important area, in which the industry currently is looking for solutions, color transfer pump systems on a printing machines are the heart of the printer. The improvement to such systems is explained herein below:
 
(5.1) current scenario – the color feeding systems to the printing machines is manual in nature. This results in wastage of expensive printing colors by 25% to 30% as the process is dependent on human intervention. Apart from the wastage aspect, there is also more water required for washing which not only leads to higher costs, but has an adverse environmental impact.

(5.2) proposed changes- the industry is exploring design of an auto color feeding system, using pneumatic or gear based pumps. This will lead to reduced wastage, lesser use of water and meeting environmental compliances  
6.	An R&D facility would be needed in Surat in order to carry out the necessary development as suggested above and come up with firm findings on which system would be better for commercialization.
7.	The following graph shows the revenue projection of India’s technical textile machine manufacturing market till 2018

 Problem: During video calls, often eye to eye contacts are missing because the camera and the screen are misaligned. During the calls, the tendency is to see on the screen and not in the camera, which leads to misaligned conversations. 
Solution desired: It is desired to design some mechanism to align both the video streams so that the conversations are effective.

 Conditioning Monitoring (CM) of electrical system is the process of systematic data collection and evaluation to identify changes in performance or conditioning of the system, or its components, such that remedial action may be planned in a cost effective manner to maintain reliability. It is the process of continuous monitoring of their electrical parameters  in order to identify a significant change which is indicative of a developing fault. Different micro-grids  groups  have been developing their own remote maintenance and diagnostic units on engineering system of their choice. The appropriate  low cost generic tools, providing safe solution are required, to address the challenge for robust and reliable micro grids.

 During recent years, due to the technological advancements many sophisticated techniques has been evolved for assuring fast recovery of the patients in hospitals. Need for good patient care in hospitals, assessment and management of fluid and electrolyte is the most fundamental thing required. All most in all hospital, an assist/nurse is responsible for monitoring the electrolyte’s bottle level. But unfortunately most of the time, the observer may forget to change the bottle at correct time due to their busy schedule.To overcome this critical situation, a IoT based automatic alerting and indicating device is proposed where sensor is used as a level sensor or weight sensor. It is based on the principle that the sensor output changes when fluid level/weight is below certain limit. When Fluid level/weight is low, will alerts the observer through the display or/and mobile phone at the control room indicates the room number of the patient for quick recovery Hospital uses simple electrolytes bottles with no indication, it may create a problem to patient because the reverse flow will start, blood start to flow from body towards bottle. In, Hospital ICU, CCU, NICU, OPD, OT, most of all department of hospital required such kind of automatic monitoring and indication system. Also Health care industries will one of the users. such monitoring system can be useful in small , medium and large size of hospitals and also it useful during home care. If such a monitoring system builds, it will decrease the chances of patients hazards and increases the accuracy of health care in hospital. In future we can design a ready mate portable cover system for such bottle. Ready mate Wearable sensors on sides of bottle can detect level/weight of-fluid inside bottles. Such data can also send to nurses and/or doctor`s mobile and they can start or stop the fluid and also monitoring fluid condition, such things required security password also. Hospital staff, the constant need to manually monitor the level of bottles is avoided. This is of high advantage to the patients especially during night times. This system also avoids the fatal risk of air bubbles entering the patient’s bloodstream, which is a serious threat as air bubbles in blood can cause immediate death. Such a device will create assurity of non-harm condition to patients. and also helpful to monitoring of data and such data can be stored and will be useful in future.

To delineate and identify flood hazard and risk assessment at Dhanera city of Banaskantha district in Gujarat, India. Dhanera covering total geographical area of 16 km2. Dhanera is located at 24.52°N 72.02°E. It has an average elevation of 128 meters (420 ft.). There is a serious need of detailed research in the development of regional or national flood damage functions for pre-disaster flood damage estimation property. Risk assessment is important in making decisions, policies and managing floods. The objective of this study was to review and synthesize concepts and techniques of flood hazard, vulnerability and risk assessment with reference to the Uttarakhad. Using geo spatial technology to model and predict the magnitude of flood risk areas, Geographic Information System (GIS) analysis techniques are used for this study the flooding causative factors such as rainfall distribution, elevation and slope, drainage network and density. This study aims at providing expertise for preparing flood mapping and estimating flood risks in growing urban areas.GIS and remote sensing play an important role in flood hazard, vulnerability and in risk assessment and useful for delineation of flood zones, preparation of flood hazard and risk maps The main advantage of using GIS for flood analyses is that it not only generates a visualization of flooding, but also creates potential to further analyze these events to estimate probable damage due to floods. Compared to traditional mapping, GIS enables the comparisons across spatial units; comparison across different themes by category of hazards and disasters; merging of qualitative with qualitative assessment and spatial database, based on which logical and/or numerical operations can be dynamically performed. These are grounds for concluding that GIS has an important function to play in natural hazards analyses because natural hazards are multi-dimensional phenomena, which have a spatial component.

Education department Gujarat,AD358,Software,Software - Web App development,Road maintenance record-keeping system,"
 The maintenance of rural and urban roads is becoming an increasing challenge as a result of the rapid growth of the network. A large amount of money is going to waste due to irregularity and improper approach. Sound asset management principles need to be introduced as an integral part of road policies and maintenance program. Comprehensive maintenance planning with schedule,institutional reforms, linkage with initial construction, maintenance backlog, utilization of fund, regular on site inspections, training to the workforce, human attitude, existing practices and knowledge of different road patterns are the major challenges in record-keeping. The maintenance and record keeping of maintenance is the key issues in the government department after the liability period over of new construction. A comprehensive system will help for planning of maintenance schedule, frame work, methodology. Also a prediction can be made for the timely maintenance fund requirements. Effective techniques can be decided for the problems. Quality of initial construction work can be achieved. It is more important to say that wastage of public fund can be reduced from the repetitive approach. Mostly, Public infrastructure is developed by the government department. It is obvious that various government bodies like municipalities, nagarpalika, panchayat and road and building department of state and central government etc. will be the potential users. Also private residential and commercial communities may use it for the maintenance records and fund estimation. A comprehensive maintenance record-keeping system will be the ready tool, which serve different aspects of complete qualitative maintenance such as, data base of complete any type of inspection on-site, recording defects including capture of images and location data to aid in repair, repair methodology applied, cost of maintenance, effective area of work, frequency of maintenance including during liability period of new constructions and fund planning for the future. It will be fruitful for the executors for social and economic development of users. Effective maintenance record keeping system will create social and economic impacts of rural roads users. It will serves ready record for long term budget planning as huge investment incurred in road infrastructure development. Some qualitative outputs such as, maintained roads provide access to where people live and important facilities such as markets, schools and health services. Good access provides the opportunity for improving livelihoods and increased employment opportunities, thereby contributing to the alleviation of poverty. Although it may be argued that the link between rural roads and poverty alleviation is mostly indirect, experience clearly shows that areas with poor road access are generally more disadvantaged than areas that are better served. The web application will contain an effective dashboard (visualization like a BI tool) which will provide different kinds of analysis , in order to take quick actions and to avoid spending excessive time in analysing this information. The application will be an effective tool as it will help save time and provide valuable information at a go to thus avoid wastage of public resource.

Education department Gujarat,AD362,Hardware,Smart Cities,Traffic Clearance for Ambulance/(or other priority Vehicle) through Artificial Intelligence,"
 Traffic is the most critical problem in major cities in India. Sometimes emergency vehicle does not get route to reach at the destination due to heavy congestion on the road. Even if its desired, driver or owner of vehicle is in such a crucial position that he/she can not give space to such emergency vehicle. Emergency vehicle may be ambulance or fire-fighting equipment carrying vehicle, police van or disaster management vehicle. In emergency situation, vehicle should reach in time at proper destination but unfortunately traffic situation block that vehicle. In emergency situation like severe heat attack, pregnancy , accident, fire etc. it is necessary for a vehicle to reach at the destination in short time. In medical emergency, it is necessary to provide emergency medical treatment to the patient. It is necessary to reach at nearest and best hospital in time. Most of cities and even district place are having problem of traffic and due to which ambulance and other emergency vehicles are not getting free route to reach at the destination. Other Emergency occurs anywhere at any location, at any time, and in various ways will make one at risk such as fire. Fire fighting vehicle must reach in time to save life and property. These situations require a speedy response. So it is very crucial and important to establish direct, fast and efficient technique without delay. Artificial intelligence may help us to solve this real life challenge. Patient, Fire brigade office, Hospitals, Police Traffic congestion has grown to an alarming event in major cities across India. Ambulance Driver will select route to reach hospital. System will automatically control traffic light based on population of vehicle and based on priority on that route. (Controls entire area surrounding route). Other features like Ambulance arrival indication to surrounding vehicle will give extra benefit. Emergency vehicle will be able to reach at the destination in time. If emergency vehicle is ambulance, patient will get treatment in time. Iif emergency vehicle is fire fighting equipment it will be able to control fire. If emergency vehicle is police van, it will be able to control crime. Vehicular traffic is endlessly increasing everywhere in the world and can cause terrible traffic congestion at intersections. This solution will allow emergency vehicle to get route during emergency situations. Traffic congestion and tidal flow are major facts that cause delay to ambulance.The loss of human life due to accident and delay in getting proper treatment must be avoided. In order to save human life from accidents and unnecessary delay due to traffic congestion will be avoided due to this solution and it will help to save precious human life.As cameras are deployed on most of the signals today, Computer Vision can be used for vehicle count and will be stored and updated in a steaming manner. This will thus help create effective algorithms to alter the time of the traffic signals based on this real time vehicle count, also by making sure that the traffic congestions doesnt increase exponentially and multiple emergency vehicles does not put the system in a deadlock.

Satellites provide wide spatial coverage of the oceans; however, they only give ocean surface information.

 To increase the transmission reliability and better service quality, connectivity through multiple links or networks, i.e., multi-homing, is considered which provides robustness and offers concurrent data transfer over multiple paths. The real-time data streaming requires low delay, jitter free transmission medium. For real-time multiplexed streams, comprising audio, video and data, the transmission reliability requirement is different for each type of stream. So, there is a need of an efficient transmission technique for such multiplexed streams with different reliability parameter settings for each stream over a multi-homed networking environment. It is also required to have a suitable handoff mechanism in case of link failover with minimum handoff latency.   

The participants must design implement and demonstrate transmission protocol with point-to-point real-time Audio, video and data conferencing application over multi-homed network.

DATA : Live Audio, video stream may be generated through webcam and mic. attached to a laptop/desktop machine for testing and evaluation.

 Schools in Sikkim are located in different terrain and during monsoon season it’s very difficult to reach every school to get data. In govt sector sometimes we need data immediately in such scenario creating data is difficult We need a software or web portal which can store data of all students across the four districts .The data storage should be block level, district level and state level. As network is very challenging throughout the state of Sikkim. Software should be design such a way that data can be entry offline and later on put into the web when network is available. Design a desktop based application that records a variety of data like attendance or students as well as teachers, marks of students, and other statutory data as required by education department. Most important aspect of this application is sync only when network is available. It should additionally provide facility to upload file separately once in a month.

Govt.of Sikkim,SG435,Hardware,Energy / Renewable Energy,Mini Hydro power project for Schools,"
 Schools in Sikkim are all located in the inclined slope where streams flow down the hill with high current. If we place small power plant in these running streams we can generate electric power which can be used in school for various power apparatus ,machine ,Labs and others daily uses. Moreover it will be good site for electric power generation. For such we are in need of equipments to set small power plants and installation guide. Design a method to develop such models that can generate considerable amount of electricity by using waste or cheap products. Demonstrate multiple models of such power generators along with documentation that can be used by students to create such models themselves.

Govt.of Sikkim,SG436,Software,Software - Web App development,Online STET (State Teacher Eligibility Test) Software or  web portal.,"
 Education Department Govt of Sikkim, every year conduct STET (State Teacher Eligibility Test) exam for all categories of teachers Primary Teacher, Graduate Teacher and Post Graduate Teacher before the recruitment exam. All the eligible candidates will apply for STET, so the applicants will be almost 5000. Checking all the documents, verifying them and issuing admit cards to individual candidate manually is a difficult job, which we are carrying for many years. During this span of time we made human error and had to repeat the processes. What we want : To make the STET exam error free and quick solution, we are in need of online software or window where candidates can login, register, fill the form and submit. Software should keep bio data of the candidate, print admits cards and later we can display online result of STET as well. During all the process automatic SMS and Email facilities should be included. Mobile app will be more convenient along with software. Challenges Network connectivity is not uniform all throughout the state of Sikkim so software should be develop in such a way that it can run with less network ,that is it can open only that window which candidate wants.
Design a application that integrates with some reliable system like DigiLocker for verification of documents, or accept documents signed by DigiLocker eSign for document verification. Reduce manual intervention wherever possible, manual verification should be done only when final offer letter is to be issued.

"Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food & Public Distribution",PM442,Hardware,Food Technology,Development of cost effective freeze and drying technology for vegetables/leaves.,"
 India ranks 2nd in world in the vegetable production. Green vegetable/leaves are mostly seasonal; they are not available throughout the year. Dehydration is one of the preservation methods to preserve these seasonal varieties because 80% of green vegetable/leaves are not consumed and are thrown in the form of garbage. In India sun drying, solar drying, electric/oil fired dryer are commonly used to dry these products. In these methods sensory quality of the product is reduced. The taste and flavour of product varies a lot from natural product. Now a day freeze drying technology is available in the country which is beyond the limit of MSMEs because of its higher cost. Efforts may be made to develop low cost technology ensuring natural taste and affordable for MSMEs.
